# Reimagine {.title-top-ice background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_reimagine.png"}

::: notes
When I think about reimagining it's about approaching known things in new ways. It's about both technology and culture and how those both interplay and influence how we contribute and who contributes. 

This is a big topic and I want to focus first on reimagining science.

## Reimagining science

[**Open science as a process**]{.midi}

::: notes
Reimagining science can start with openly available publications like Mine has showed us. But but we don't have to limit ourselves to only sharing at the end when things are final - that's a cultural artifact of how hard it used to be to print and share physical journal articles. Only sharing at the end delays the solutions we draw from science and it also maintains long-standing barriers and inequities of who gets to contribute in science.

<> So we can go beyond open products and think about **open science as a process**.  This includes sharing code as well as sharing ideas earlier, through blog posts describing experimental design or slides from a conference that share work in progress. There is a benefit to to sharing the process of science earlier, because ideas can be refined through feedback and leveraged in new ways so that we're not all reinventing on our own. 

This is where the open web and tools like Quarto are transforming science communication into something that is not something limited at the end but is an active part of ongoing research and enables a broader diversity of contributors.

But we can go beyond this and think about open science as the process of doing science within a lab group or research community. This is thinking about **Open science as a process that is deliberately inclusive**. The benefit of this is that diverse communities are more innovative (which many studies have shown). Yet this is still a radical idea in science, where our communication is oriented around the printing press. It's a radical idea that everyone no matter where they are in terms of experience or seniority has something to contribute and also something to learn. I first experienced this feeling of deliberate inclusion from open source communities like R and Mozilla and that feeling is what Openscapes is trying to amplify in science. 

As we've grown we've continued to learn and incorporate inclusion more boldly in Openscapes curriculum and activities, because it is a practice that we can all improve just we can with coding and data science. 

transition: The FayLab is an example of a research group that is operationalizing this.

##

<> Their FayLab Manual was co-created by the group to document documents things like lab culture and philosophy, onboarding procedures and expectations, as well as where data and files are kept, how to use the server and how to learn new skills and software that are the norms in the lab group. This is a published, living document that is useful no matter what research everybody is working on because these are common elements that build this lab community. There's 3 things I want to highlight about it: 

It's main purpose is to be a shared resource for existing groups members to all be clear on how their group works together and in practical terms, it immediately reduces the number of would-be emails asking each other where things are. It **makes what is normally implicit explicit**, and in doing so it puts the values forward and to welcome people with information before they even join the lab group. 

<> The Faylab takes this a step further because in reading the LabManual you learn how to contribute to it. So you're learning tools like Quarto and GitHub to fix a typo and those skills will also be valuable for your science. This practice of **onboarding learners as contributors** really values learners and empowers them in a lasting way. This is really culture shift in action because they have now experienced science where they can contribute on Day 1 and don't have to wait for the printing press in order to have a voice. It's like learning ggplot the first morning of an R course because those early wins that you can see helps people reimagine what they can do themselves as well as what they can do for science.

This is working because there is also focus on **building trust and psychological safety** within the group. Psychological safety is the “shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking” so people feel comfortable speaking up and asking questions. This group helps establish that through live coding which normalizes making mistakes, really prioritizing time at the beginning of meetings to get to know each other and share interests

Establishing this kind of culture is critcal because it really does require bravery to participate in open science and to share work earlier that might be imperfect.

Quarto has been a really powerful tool for us already for culture change because it's a workflow that people can contribute to early, whether or not they are contributing code.

**TO DO: Low priority - animate these to come on automatically one by one**

::: notes
These are more examples of the Openscapes community helping shift science culture using Quarto. These images are all linked so you can learn more about each; they are all examples of **sharing work earlier** and in a way that doesn't mean lower quality, but it means unfinished and open for feedback and connecting across silos.

And these are all examples of **reusing and extending good ideas,** since incorporates pieces of previous work but are designed for specific audiences and that lets each site be intentional about meeting people where they are, whether it's a manual or a cloud workshop or a way to connect early adopters and build their open science community at NOAA Fisheries.

What's beautiful about this too is that we can use Quarto as a tool both for reproducible research and for culture change. It is a powerful tool to lower barriers for collaboration and contribution across skillsets, and RStudio IDE Visual Editor is another way that lowers barriers.

::: notes
Let me now demo Quarto with the Visual Editor. I think it's a friendly way for new learners, who may or may not code, to create and contribute. But, I don't mean to imply that it's only for new folks; it's designed for markdown-savvy people as well.

In fact J.J. Allaire said that he prefers to do his own writing in the visual editor. So it seems to hit this sweet spot as a really inclusive tool that enables collaborating across coding comfort levels. And that's in additional to Quarto enabling collaboration across different coding languages like R and Python.

**Reimagine what contributing looks like and how we value it**


::: notes
And it's really up to all of us in science and otherwise to enable reimagining together. Each of us play a role in how we work and learn and teach, and together we really examine the defaults and ask questions so that we see the barriers and opportunities and are actionable to address them. 

So I'll end where I began and say that the work we do is at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. And we see all of this as part of the climate movement.

::: notes
We take so much inspiration from groups like All We Can Save, who say "What this moment calls for is a mosaic of voices -- the full spectrum of ideas and insights for how we
can turn things around."

Addressing the climate crisis isn't just about recycling and efficient light bulbs - although those are important. It's about centering climate in the work that we do and thinking about how to join and strengthen and support each other as this mosaic of voices.


Solutions exist like lightbulbs and regenerative farming but what has been missing is meaningful collaboration, both on the tooling and on the cultural side. We think that Openscapes and quarto really can help this cultural shift

Openscapes is part of this mosaic of voices where we're helping shift how scientists work and collaborate and Quarto is enabling and accelerating this shift. By sharing openly, quickly, imperfectly and supporting others that are more rapid sharers, but we can play a meaningful role in contributing and role modeling and empowering others in this greater effort. 



There's so much more to contribute, so much more to do. 

I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. Looking forward to this collective community to continue to contribute to this mosiac
