**Mine:** So Julie will now tell us a bit about reimagining with Quarto.

**Julie:** Thanks Mine. We've seen already how much Quarto enables with teach/collab/share

And now I want to push it a bit further. What if we could reimagine open science and open source as part of the climate movement. We know what this R community is capable of, what if

To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver.

Because **we are in a climate emergency**. We must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver. Hard, big. My hope lies in what we have here and what we can do with it. This is a big movement - 

Let's think about this with 3 user groups if you will

scientist working direct w climate - hard and stuck. Openscapes 

R/open source - stuck, Posit 100 yrs 

extensible beyond

Every solution, every solver. Across all facets and geographies, skills, expertise. We need more women. We need more people of color. We need more perspectives on every level. Dial up inclusion and culture change and welcome at an unprecedented level

Requires slowing to speed up

But when it speeds up it's like a flywheel

My colleague Ileana Fenwick is a marine ecologist who particpated in Openscapes last year and beautifully describes this

Because of Openscapes, I have renewed hope in how we can bring about a kinder future in science. I see a commitment in the open science community to bridging the gaps where we've left members of our community behind, and it inspires me.

Culture shifts: <br> technical + human
:::

::: notes
We're talking about a **profound culture shift** that involves real deliberate work on the tech and human side

Let's focus on the human side: We can **build inclusion into our daily work**. Let's think about your team and collagues because I bet they're not different from the teams we mentor

This means **talking** and reflecting with your colleagues: how do we work? shared workflows, where is friction? who contributes, how do they contributes? Handoffs?

This means asking **questions** and really listening. might not have the language to describe where they're stuck. Not assuming, not solutioneering. But listening for understanding to meet them where they are

This means being **braver** to say I don't know, I need help

A practice, not a checklist. 

A practical example -

Fay Lab Manual is a site created by Gavin Fay's Group UMass D
They are quant fisheries ecologists: data and code: work with managers: food systems and climate
Bc formal training in data science is uncommon in env, range of skills incoming
This site: lab culture, code of conduct, info about how they name files, how to learn the software they use


It's a living doc online, and it's imperfect

It is radical in many ways, here are 3:

**onboards learners as contributors** As you read the manual you're also instructed how to contribute. So it's through learning tools like Quarto to fix a typo that empowers learners in a lasting way.

**psychological safety & growth mindset** deliberately for example prioritzing time to check in during meetings and screensharing/live coding.

Reimagining within one lab and that idea is catching at bigger scales -

We forked this idea back
Here are 2 more examples: our Approach Guide which is how we onboard ourselves and others to grow the movement

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding comfort levels, which means it's a friendly tool
Also means we can broaden our idea of collaborators substantially and earlier.

And, then RStudio IDE Visual Editor further lowers barriers

I'll do one final demo here - Friendly for new learners, also for experienced users. 

Think about how you might use this yourself, and teach a colleague
