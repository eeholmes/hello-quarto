# Reimagine {.title-top-ice background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_reimagine.png"}

::: notes
We're helping teams reimagine how they work, thinking differently about approaching big challenges as part of their daily work

this is important because our work is part of the climate movement.

We've seen a really important benefit of an open science mindset how their daily work is connected to the broader big picture. **Our work is part of the climate movement.** It's about helping people who care deeply about climate to bring that to their work through open science

It's about connecting big challenges with small daily actions. People are feeling stuck by things big and small - 

So we help them develop open science as a mindset, that is about their process and extends beyond the open products alone

This quote from Ileana Fenwick represents why we do the work we do, and why it's so important to focus on inclusion and people and seeing this connection

Because of Openscapes, I have renewed hope in how we can bring about a kinder future in science through collaboration. I see a commitment in the open science community to bridging the gaps where we've left members of our community behind, and it inspires me.

Tech <> culture
:::

::: notes
Empowering people is about tech and culture together. 

- Reducing barriers

- Deliberate inclusion

- What contributions are valued and by whom


It really does require both technical skills and bravery to participate in open science.

Solutions exist like lightbulbs and regenerative farming but what has been missing is meaningful collaboration, both on the tooling and on the cultural side. We think that Openscapes and quarto really can help this cultural shift

Quarto has been a really powerful tool for us already for culture change because it's a workflow that people can contribute to early, whether or not they are contributing code.

Fay Lab Manual: co-created open, living document: lab culture, onboarding, where data and files are kept, where to learn skills

**Makes the implicit explicit**  all be clear on how their group works together and in practical terms, it immediately reduces the number of would-be emails asking each other where things are. and it also puts the values forward and to welcome people with information before they even join the lab group.

**onboards learners as contributors** As you read the manual you're also instructed how to contribute. So it's through learning tools like Quarto to fix a typo that empowers learners in a lasting way. 

**psychological safety & growth mindset** deliberately for example prioritzing time to check in during meetings and screensharing/live coding.

Here are 2 more examples: our Approach Guide which is how we onboard ourselves and others. It complements our Lesson Series which is the content of what we teach
NMFS-Openscapes is using Quarto to building open science community across NOAA Fisheries and help connect r users and open science folks as well as folks that are feeling stuck and want to join. 

What's beautiful about this too is that we can use Quarto as a tool both for reproducible research and for culture change. And part of this is because -

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding comfort levels, which means we can broaden our idea of collaborators substantially. 

And, then RStudio IDE Visual Editor further lowers barriers for collab and contrib.

Friendly for new learners, also for experienced users. In fact I know J.J. Allaire prefers to do his own writing in the visual editor.

## We all can enable reimagining {.takeaway .center}

::: notes
We all can enable reimagining in our daily habits and actions, can rethink defaults, ask more questions, listen more, not assume tech, help each other, and connect our daily work to the bigger efforts like climate.

And it's really up to all of us in science and otherwise to enable reimagining together. Each of us play a role in how we work and learn and teach, and really have a responsibility to examine the defaults around us and learn how they might be barriers to reduce or opportunities to leverage

To close, I'll end where I began and say that the work we do with Openscapes is at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. We're helping shift how data-intensive researchers and collaborate and Quarto is enabling and accelerating this shift. And we see all of this as part of the climate movement.

I'll leave you with this quote from All We Can Save, who say "We cannot, must not, go it alone"

I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. I am so appreciative of this community. We're just at the beginning of our journey with Openscapes and Quarto and we're excited to continue to build with all of you
