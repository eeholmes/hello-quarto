FULL QUOTE UPCOMING Openscapes has really helped me think about science
differently, it's more collaborative and less lonely, with so many
people in open science as infinite ways to learn...

\

Ileana Fenwick
:::

::: notes
I love this quote from Ileana Fenwick, who says “Openscapes has been transformative for me as a scientist, as a team leader, and for our program…it has highlighted how much we can learn from each other, not just related to whatever project or issue we're working on, but also related to how we work. And it's created a forum for us to learn and share across programs and divisions.” (PLACEHOLDER)

Ileana is a marine scientist who was mentored through Openscapes and is now seeing new ways to support Black researchers through open science. This kind of experience is such a powerful example of paying things forward, connecting and extending
dots.

To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape
society. We need every solution and every solver. As the saying goes, to
change everything, we need everyone. **What this moment calls for is a
mosaic of voices** -- the full spectrum of idea and insights for how we
can turn things around.\

*All We Can Save*

::: notes
Because this work is part of addressing the climate emergency. We take so much inspiration from groups like All We
Can Save, who say "To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape
society. We need every solution and every solver. As the saying goes, to
change everything, we need everyone. What this moment calls for is a
mosaic of voices the full spectrum of idea and insights for how we
can turn things around."

I find this quote so empowering because I want to be part of that mosaic of voices. It's not saying that Openscapes and Quarto are going to save us, but we can play a meaningful role in contributing to this greater effort.

Openscapes is contributing to a culture shift, and Quarto is enabling and accelerating it. 

This Openscapes Approach Guide is one small example. This Guide has no code in it, but we're using Quarto because it is gives us a really nimble way to write and publish. Additionally, it role models how non-code contributions are really important in these large-scale cultural shifts. 

This was a place to write things down and share them, and really make the implicit explicit, first so that we consistent in how we work but also to welcome others to our approach, whether they're learning from us or on their own. 

I've talked a lot about NASA already but we've also been working with Mentors from NOAA Fisheries and the Cal EPA, as well as growing our team. This guide was a good way to onboard them, and to help them be not only learners but also contributors. They all had contributions they could make as new learners, no matter where they were starting from. We were able to onboard them to Quarto so that they could contribute early expertise and perspectives that could improve. 
(similar to ggplot?)

And it's also a way to amplify good ideas. We borrowed this idea from what we saw from other open source activities, particularly in the R and Mozilla communities. 

And Quarto has let us scale this mosaic of voices and make these ideas
actionable in a variety of ways.

**TO DO: Low priority - animate these to come on automatically one by one**

::: notes
I've talked a lot about NASA, but over the last year we have also been working with NOAA Fisheries, with the Cal EPA, and with science groups as well as growing our team. These groups are all addressing the climate
emergency, and they're doing this more elegantly and collaboratively
with Openscapes and Quarto. They've been engaging, empowering and amplifying others 

Mosaic allows across languages and comfort

The fact that Quarto works across languages like Python and R is so
useful for us, and it's been equally valuable for this to work across
coding comfort levels. 

In the broadest sense of the climate movement, 
Many people do not identify as coders - in fact
training in data is one of the largest unmet needs for environmental
researchers and those are the ones in a data-intensive science program.
Quarto helps us blur the lines

but it's been really useful for others. Can move this forward

Within this mosaic of voices, there is a range of technical skills, and
it's important that that whole range can contribute and that a divide
between who is technical or not, and this gap is widening. To make this
mosaic of voices actionable to tackle these big problems, we need
strategies to close those gaps and blur those lines.

## We can all help reimagine through reducing barriers, blurring lines {.takeaway .center background-image="images/2019ESWPoster316x24MTeditnoNP_cropped_sm_er.jpeg" background-opacity="0.1"}

Space and place
A big focus of Openscapes is helping researchers build psychologically safety within their teams, so that there is a strong culture of peer-learning and teaching, of asking questions, not assuming what people know or don't know, and trying to blur the lines of who can participate in technology.

Through our work we've found again and again the importance of **space and place**: space for a mosaic of voices to come together and learn and share and find the common, and really transition behavior in a way that can be intimidating. And place where they can write things down, collaborate and share in really streamlined ways. Together this helps people feel less stuck, learn new skills, get comfortable sharing work earlier, and braver about sharing imperfect work

**Reimagine what contributing looks like and how we value it**

\

**Contribution formats:** beyond traditional manuscripts: websites, slides, etc

\

**Science communication:** share earlier and as you want, openly

\

**Open science:** not just products but process and people

\

***Who*** **contributes:** who is psychologically safe and supported
:::

::: notes
This is about reimagining how we contribute as a mosiac of voices and
how we value contribution.

Quarto has been lowering the barriers and blurring lines of who can contribute
their ideas and insights in this open sharable way 

These are just a few. Changes how you think

Across not only coding languages, but across coding comforts.

Reimagining together
Reimagining how we tackle challenges means integrating new tech, new
behavior, new culture.

See across levels of "finish". sharing imperfect work - the way that we
work, the softwared the workflows they've learned to use

Sharing openly, quickly, imperfectly - by bringinging together our way
of working with Quarto, supporing mentors that are more rapid sharers.
(tie to climate emergency and quarto) Quarto is theProduct/place, for
our process, people

We had the people and the process but we didn't have the place. When
Quarto snapped into place, we were able to reimagine how we work
togethre.

Contributing openly as a way to work + removing barriers

Like we said it's openly it's a movement. Like All We Can save we can't
go it alone.

And it's been cool to see how Quarto has enabled us to not only reuse
things like tutorials but also ideas like how to design and facilitate
learning events. One of the things here is that open science is a way to
work. It's not just about products, it's about process. It's about
people.

Transition: So these examples so far have been about openly creating
documentation for your team, which is a big part of reimagining how we
work. And it's also an opportunity to extend this in other resources as
well.

Bri: Openscapes is doing its own level of trying to do culture shift
with science, focused on building inclusion, empathy, and openness into
our daily work. And Quarto is enabling and accelerating part of that
paradigm shift because it helps bring this mosiac of voices together.

it's been really useful for others. Can move this forward

Just want to emphasize the power of removing barriers and blurring
lines. of who's a coder or not

Blurring between fed agencies, between researchers, between people who
do and don't identify as coders, what lang you use, how technical you
are

Mosiac of voices: we need everyone

Growing the mosaic. meeting people where they were I reimagined how I
worked with groups. I learned how to work with groups. **Transition of
behavior is the power of Openscapes.**

Blurred: End the mosiac: through this work for this last year, we've
been able to remove barrier and I really appreciate having this opp to
share this with all of you. Looking forward to this collective community
contributes to this mosiac

Lights at Night Rivers - instead: patchwork of landuse. Landsat. Mosiac.

This is just the beginning. There's so much more to write, so much more
to do, we need the Earthrise quote. Do more than cop, grounded, steady,
ready

when it comes to who is a coder and not and how we value contribution.

The more we talk about this and role model what's possible, the more
actionable we all become.

And throughout all of this is the idea that we can collaborate across
coding comfort levels. It's been really neat to see how Quarto can not
only reduce barriers across coding languages like python and R, but also
differnt experience levels.

This is a screenshot of the new Visual Editor that is part of the
RStudio IDE, and it's something we've been experimenting with more and
more. We've found this to be a really nice way to write prose even for
those familiar with Markdown, but it's also a friendlier way for people
to get to know the tools.

This is about not assuming technical skills, but creating an safe
culture where they can say what they don't know and reinforce a
peer-learning & teaching culture, and using tooling that is friendly for
new and seasoned coders alike.

Transition: Let me demo Quarto with the Visual editor - it's really
exciting to blur those lines between who identifies as a coder or not
using these tools collaboratively.
