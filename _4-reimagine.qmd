# Reimagine {.title-top-ice background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_reimagine.png"}

::: notes
When I think about reimagining it's an interplay of technology and culture. It's about how we contribute and how we value contributions and contributions by whom. 

So I have more stories of Quarto and Openscapes, and specifically about reimagining science.

## Reimagining science

[Beyond open products: **open process**]{.midi}

::: notes
Reimagining science can start with openly available publications like Mine has showed us, but that's often limited to finalized work and thus slows scientific progress, and it limits when new voices can be heard in a way that deepens inequities about who can participate in science.

So we can go **beyond open products and think about open process**. Sharing the process of science openly can be about sharing code and data early, and it can be about sharing writing early, through blog posts as you go or, published slides from a conference presention or a project website where people can learn more. 

This is where the open web and tools like Quarto are transforming science communication as we know it into something that is an active part of ongoing research with a broader diversity of contributors.

But some research groups are going beyond that too and sharing **open process that is deliberately inclusive**. This idea is still radical in science and it's something borrowed from the open source community. 
I've experienced it through the R and Mozilla communities and it has equal focus with data science in terms of what we teach through research groups through Openscapes. And the FayLab at UMass Dartmouth is an example of groups operationalizing this.

<> The FayLab Manual is a place where they share how their research group works and how they collaborate. It's written to **make the implicit explicit** as a resource for existing group members and thus reduces the number of would-be emails, and as a way to put values forward and to welcome people with information that includes the lab culture and philosophy, onboarding procedures and expectations, as well as where data and files are kept, and how to learn new skills that are the norms in the lab group. 

The Faylab Manual takes this a step further and helps people contribute to this resource as they learn, so they can start by updating links, fixing typos while learning tools for their science like Quarto and GitHub. This practice of **onboarding learners as contributors** really values learners rather than infantilizing them, and empowers them in a lasting way since they can contribute on Day 1 rather than waiting until they have a journal pub to have a voice. It's like learning ggplot the first morning of an R course because those early wins that you can see helps people reimagine what they can do themselves as well as what they can do for science.

This is working because there is also focus on **building trust and psychological safety** so people feel comfortable speaking up and asking questions. This group helps establish that through live coding which normalizes making mistakes, really prioritizing time at the beginning of meetings to get to know each other and share interestsm, and through continually learning new pedagogy and approaches for inclusion, like teaching R with the tidyverse.

Establishing this kind of culture is critcal because it really does require bravery to share work earlier that might be imperfect, and we are all learners and all need room to grow and contribute as we do so that we're not limiting progress. 

Quarto is a really powerful tool for culture change in this way because it's also friendlier to new learners and it works right out-of-the-box and lets you share your work earlier.

**TO DO: Low priority - animate these to come on automatically one by one**

::: notes
These are more examples of the Openscapes community helping shift the culture in science using Quarto. I've talked about NASA and the FayLab, but there are other groups including NOAA Fisheries who are using Quarto as a way to connect early adopters and build their open science community.

All of these are examples of **sharing work earlier** and in a way that doesn't mean lower quality, but it means unfinished. By sharing imperfect work it's a way to welcome contributions and accelerate science because there is room for early feedback and less reinventing in our own silos.

And these are all examples of **reusing and extending good ideas,** since incorporates pieces of previous work but are designed for specific audiences and that lets each be intentional about meeting people where they are.

What's beautiful about this too is that we can use Quarto as a tool both for research and for culture change. It is a powerful tool that is already designed to lower barriers to collaboration, and those barriers are lowering even more through the RStudio IDE Visual Editor. 

The visual editor is something that we've been experimenting with more and more and I'm excited to demo it for you. I think it's a friendly way for new learners, who may or may not code, to contribute to open science using Quarto. But, I don't mean to imply that it's only for new folks; it's designed for markdown-savvy people as well.

So you don't have to be savvy with code or markdown to contribute, although like I said, it's designed for those savvy users too. In fact J.J. Allaire said that he prefers to do his own writing in the visual editor. So it seems to hit this sweet spot as a really inclusive tool that enables collaborating across coding comfort levels. And that's in additional to Quarto enabling collaboration across different coding languages like R and Python.

**Reimagine what contributing looks like and how we value it**

\

**Contribution formats:** interoperate with leverage the open web

\

**Science communication:** share earlier and as you want, openly

\

**Open as a way to work:** not just products but process and people

\

***Who*** **contributes:** who is psychologically safe and supported
:::

::: notes
And on the cultural side, it's all of us. Each of us play a role in reimagining through our actions and how we trouble the defaults we see and how we can reduce barriers for others. 

It's important to bring more people in as valued contributors not only because it makes all of our work better and because now more than ever, we need everybody. 

With Openscapes, we see our work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science as part of the climate movement. 

one person and one lab group isn't going to change the culture alone, it's going to take far more of us from all different geographies. And I'm not talking just about science, I'm thinking much bigger -

::: notes
We take so much inspiration from groups like All We Can Save, who say "To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape
society. We need every solution and every solver. ... What this moment calls for is a
mosaic of voices -- the full spectrum of idea and insights for how we
can turn things around."

Addressing the climate crisis isn't just about recycling and efficient light bulbs - although those are important. It's about centering climate justice in the work that we do and thinking about how to join and strengthen and support not only scientists but the whole mosaic of voices.


Solutions exist like lightbulbs and regenerative farming but what has been missing is meaningful collaboration, both on the tooling and on the cultural side. We think that Openscapes and quarto really can help this cultural shift

Openscapes is part of this mosaic of voices where we're helping shift how scientists work and collaborate and Quarto is enabling and accelerating this shift. By sharing openly, quickly, imperfectly and supporting others that are more rapid sharers, but we can play a meaningful role in contributing and role modeling and empowering others in this greater effort. 



There's so much more to contribute, so much more to do. 

I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. Looking forward to this collective community to continue to contribute to this mosiac
