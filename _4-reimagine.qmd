# Reimagine {.title-top-ice background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_reimagine.png"}

::: notes
With Openscapes we're helping teams reimagine how they work. 

We help them see what's possible with tools and teamwork and develop a shared open science mindset that about how what they do nearby and daily can have profound impacts on the big challenges they face.

To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver.

::: notes
And this is critical because **our work helps address the climate emergency**. And we need every solution and every solver. And deliberately welcoming people as a solver and helping connect their daily work with the climate movement and help them get unstuck and reimagine what they can do is such a critical part of our work. When teams we work start creating annual environmental reports save 60 days a year in creating that report, they can refocus that time on further solutions AND have shared energy and hope with the teams they they work with. 

And let me be clear that we all have contibutions we can make to the climate movement. I've talked with a lot of you and know you care deeply about climate, and who might not feel like your work is directly aligned with the climate movement, but what if you made it align? Epi studying health in relations to heat waves, neuro studying behav related to climate displacement, contributing to make research pipelines more efficient, there is so much we can do together if we take this energy we feel together from open data science and make that part of the climate movement

This quote from Ileana Fenwick represents the impact of our approach and the critical importance of inclusion in this effort:

Because of Openscapes, I have renewed hope in how we can bring about a kinder future in science. I see a commitment in the open science community to bridging the gaps where we've left members of our community behind, and it inspires me.

Culture shifts: <br> technical + human
:::

::: notes
So we're talking about profound culture shift and this involves real work on the tech side and the human side

We need to really examine the default behavior - and prioritize investment on the human side as much as we do on the tech side be deliberate and intentional about inclusion. 

This means reflecting on what kinds of contributions are valuble, and by whom? This means asking colleagues questions and not making assumptions about what people know. Many if not most people have never been formally trained in working with data or code, and, we often make assumptions that they have been. are valuable contributors.

RMarkdown and now Quarto has been a really powerful tool for us to make this work actionable and visiable to support people and shift culture around open science

Fay Lab Manual: this is an open, living document to document lab culture, onboarding, where data and files are kept, where to learn skills

Before I go into details: let's set the scene for what environmental research groups generally are like. 

- similar to your teams
  - people have different deliverables, they oft don't feel like a team
  - very few people formally trained in responsible w data and code, and not precedent
  - not everyone's job will ever need to include data wrangling, but that doesn't mean they can't be a valuable contributor
  - but their contribution to science is very valuable
  - people have expertise and knowlege that you can learn from maybe as much as they can learn from you about code

So what this lab manual does it: 

**Makes the implicit explicit**  all be clear on how their group works together and it also puts the values forward and to welcome people who might be interested in joining the

**onboards learners as contributors** As you read the manual you're also instructed how to contribute. So it's through learning tools like Quarto to fix a typo that empowers learners in a lasting way. 

**psychological safety & growth mindset** deliberately for example prioritzing time to check in during meetings and screensharing/live coding. 

This has been a model for us -

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding comfort levels, which means we can broaden our idea of collaborators substantially and earlier. 

And, then RStudio IDE Visual Editor further lowers barriers for collab and contrib.

Friendly for new learners, also for experienced users. In fact I know Mine prefers to do her own writing in the visual editor.
