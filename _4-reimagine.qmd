# Reimagine {.title-top-ice background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_reimagine.png"}

::: notes
With Openscapes we think about reimagine big things in new ways. 
We're helping teams reimagine how they work, thinking differently about approaching big challenges as part of their daily work

We've seen a really important benefit of an open science mindset how their daily work is connected to the broader big picture.

**Our work is part of the climate movement.** It's about helping people who care deeply about climate to bring that to their work through open science

Climate change, there's not going to be one single fix, it's going to be a collective effort with everyone playing a role.

This quote from Ileana Fenwick represents why we do the work we do, and why it's so important to focus on inclusion and people and seeing this connection

Because of Openscapes, I have renewed hope in how we can bring about a kinder future in science. I see a commitment in the open science community to bridging the gaps where we've left members of our community behind, and it inspires me.

Culture shifts: <br> technical side + human side
:::

::: notes
it's about seeing inclusion as a daily practice in their work, and that that connects to the climate movement. There can be a gap between who's tech and not, and we're not going to solve these big challenges with tech alone. It's going to be with many smaller things. 

We've got to think beyond efficient lightbulbs and recycling for what we can do every day: what if....

some people who are scientists who work with teams and data don't write code

Quarto has been a really powerful tool for us already for culture change because it's a workflow that people can contribute to early, whether or not they are contributing code.

Fay Lab Manual: this is an open, living document to document lab culture, onboarding, where data and files are kept, where to learn skills

Before I go into details: let's set the scene for what environmental research groups are like. 

  - lab group working on env sci: not everyone is trained
  - people have different deliverables, they oft
  - not everyone's job description means wrangingl
  - but their contribution to science is very valuable

So what this lab manual does it: 

**Makes the implicit explicit**  all be clear on how their group works together and it also puts the values forward and to welcome people who might be interested in joining the

**onboards learners as contributors** As you read the manual you're also instructed how to contribute. So it's through learning tools like Quarto to fix a typo that empowers learners in a lasting way. 

**psychological safety & growth mindset** deliberately for example prioritzing time to check in during meetings and screensharing/live coding. 

This has been a model for us -

Here are 2 more examples: our Approach Guide which is how we onboard ourselves and others to grow the movement

And NOAA Fisheries is using Quarto to building open science community across their science centers

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding comfort levels, which means we can broaden our idea of collaborators substantially. 

And, then RStudio IDE Visual Editor further lowers barriers for collab and contrib.

Friendly for new learners, also for experienced users. In fact I know Mine prefers to do her own writing in the visual editor.

transition: So I said that reimagining contributions in science is an interplay of technology and culture, and have just showed tools on the technical side
:::



::: notes
We all can enable reimagining in our daily habits and actions, can rethink defaults, ask more questions, listen more, not assume tech, help each other, and connect our daily work to the bigger efforts like climate.

And it's really up to all of us in science and otherwise to enable reimagining together. Each of us play a role in how we work and learn and teach, and really have a responsibility to examine the defaults around us and learn how they might be barriers to reduce or opportunities to leverage

To close, I'll end where I began and say that the work we do with Openscapes is at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. We're helping shift how data-intensive researchers and collaborate and Quarto is enabling and accelerating this shift. And we see all of this as part of the climate movement.

"We" speaks to the collective, to collaboration, to community, to the relational work at hand. Addressing the climate crisis...will take everyone. 

We cannot, we must not, go it alone.

I'll leave you with this quote from All We Can Save, who say "We cannot, must not, go it alone"

I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. I am so appreciative of this community. We're just at the beginning of our journey with Openscapes and Quarto and we're excited to continue to build with all of you
