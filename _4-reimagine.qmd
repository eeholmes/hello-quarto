# Reimagine {.title-top-ice background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_reimagine.png"}

::: notes
When I think about reimagining it's about seeing how something is and then approaching it in a different way. And often it's about how technology influences culture and the other way around. It's about how we contribute and how we value contributions and contributions by whom. 

In science, there are a lot of ways to reimagine -

## Reimagining science

[Beyond open products: **open process**]{.midi}

::: notes
Sharing scientific results through published manuscripts is a tradition that's been around forever, and it's a tradition that only happens at the very end, when everything is finalized. This is likely because of technology - the printing press and mailing physical copies to each other, but it's instilled in scientific culture that you don't share until the end out at that point you're really only share the products of your science as a static, perfect, final thing. It also reinforces hierarchy and limits new perspectives in a way that not only deepens inequities about who can participate in science but slows scientific progress. 

Open science has rightly first focused on sharing these products more openly but now we can think **beyond open products and think about open process**. Sharing the process of sharing science openly can look like writing blog posts as you do field work or experiments, sharing slides that you're presenting at a conference, or having a project website so that when someone asks "do you have a url for that"? you can say, well yes in fact I do. This is where the open web and tools like Quarto can transform science communication as we currently know it into something that is actively occurring while research is ongoing.

[**Make the implicit explicit**]{.midi}

[**Onboard learners as contributors**]{.midi}

[**Build trust and psychological safety**]{.midi}

:::
:::

::: notes
Another level of this is **open process that is deliberately inclusive**.
The Faylab Manual is an example of this, which shares how their research group works and how they collaborate. It's written to put their values forward and to welcome people with information that includes the lab culture and philosophy, onboarding procedures and expectations, as well as where data and files are kept, how they name things, and how to learn new skills that are norms in the lab group. By making what is normally implicit explicit, this kind of open process can help set people up for success. 

The Faylab Manual takes this a step further and helps people contribute to this manual as they learn, with first by updating links or fixing typos but also by clarifying points and filling gaps and adding new ideas. This practice of onboarding learners as contributors is a really powerful way to reimagine science. It really values learners rather than infantilizing them, and offers different ways of being creative and valuing expertise. If there is a culture where you can contribute on Day 1, it's so much more empowering than having to wait till a journal pub to share or have a voice. It's like learning ggplot the first morning of an R course and really feeling your own power and what you can do. 

Having an open process and sharing sooner like the Faylab is doing is a technical thing and cultural thing. On the cultural side, establishing psychological safety where people feel comfortable speaking up and asking questions must be a deliberate part of reimagining science. It really requires bravery to share imperfect work and make mistakes and feeling supported during that process is critical. 

And on the technical side, picking tools like Quarto that are friendlier to learners and work right out-of-the-box lets you focus on your content, like Mine said earlier.

**TO DO: Low priority - animate these to come on automatically one by one**

::: notes
The Openscapes community that is using Quarto includes the Fay Lab and NASA as well as NOAA Fisheries and the California EPA. All of these are about open process - they are guides like the lab manual, they are workshop resources, invited talks, and some like NOAA Fisheries example is modled after NASA-Openscapes and is a grassroots effort to build community across traditional silos and make visible the need and momentum for open science. All of these are created openly and for specific audiences because we've seen and felt the value of meeting folks where they are and designing for inclusion. We've been able to reuse and extend ideas that we've seen in other places in open source communities like RLadies and Mozilla and Pangeo. 

Few of us would identify as pro Quarto users or software developers or web designers and  what's beautiful about this is that we don't have to be. We can be scientists. We can use Quarto as a tool both for research and for culture change. It is a friendly and powerful tool, and it's even getting even moreso through the visual editor. 

The visual editor is something that we've been experimenting with more and more and I'm excited to demo it for you. I think it's a friendly way for new learners, who may or may not code, to contribute to open science using quarto. But, I don't mean to imply that it's only for new folks; it's designed for markdown-savvy people as well.

So the Visual Editor and Quarto enables collaborating across coding comfort levels. You don't have to be savvy with code or markdown to contribute, although like I said, it's designed for those savvy users too. In fact J.J. Allaire said that he prefers to do his own writing in the visual editor. So it seems to hit this sweet spot as a really inclusive tool across different coding comfort levels. And that's on top of Quarto working across different coding languages like R and Python. 

So these tools are the technical side of reimagining who can contribute in science.

**Reimagine what contributing looks like and how we value it**

\

**Contribution formats:** interoperate with leverage the open web

\

**Science communication:** share earlier and as you want, openly

\

**Open as a way to work:** not just products but process and people

\

***Who*** **contributes:** who is psychologically safe and supported

::: notes
And the other side is the cultural side. We can enable reimagining by reducing barriers.
With Openscapes and Quarto we've seen reduced barriers between and across fed agencies, between researchers and developers.

Going back to the FayLab manual, this is about making the implicit explicit, valuing learners and enabling their contribution, and building a psychological safety. Thinking back to Gavin Fay, after a seminar earlier this year he was asked how he fosters psycholoical safety in his lab group and he said 3 things that came to mind were live coding which normalizes making mistakes, really prioritizing time to get to know each other and share interests like you what birds did you see this weekend, and also to follow pedagogical approaches to onboarding more inclusively, like teaching R with the tidyverse.

So this is good advice and it's important to share and normalize sharing this kind of advice because one person and one lab group isn't going to change the culture alone, it's going to take far more of us from all different geographies. And I'm not talking just about science, I'm thinking much bigger - 

It's important to bring more people in as valued contributors not only because it makes all of our work better and because now more than ever, we need everybody. 

With Openscapes, we see our work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science as part of the climate movement.

::: notes
We take so much inspiration from groups like All We Can Save, who say "To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape
society. We need every solution and every solver. ... What this moment calls for is a
mosaic of voices -- the full spectrum of idea and insights for how we
can turn things around."

Addressing the climate crisis isn't just about recycling and efficient light bulbs - although those are important. It's about centering climate justice in the work that we do and thinking about how to join and strengthen and support not only scientists but the whole mosaic of voices.

Solutions exist like lightbulbs and regenerative farming but what has been missing is meaningful collaboration, both on the tooling and on the cultural side. We think that Openscapes and quarto really can help this cultural shift

Openscapes is part of this mosaic of voices where we're trying to unify and extend open practices to address the climate crisis, and Quarto is enabling and accelerating this shift. By sharing openly, quickly, imperfectly and supporting others that are more rapid sharers, but we can play a meaningful role in contributing and role modeling and empowering others in this greater effort. 



There's so much more to contribute, so much more to do. 

I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. Looking forward to this collective community to continue to contribute to this mosiac
