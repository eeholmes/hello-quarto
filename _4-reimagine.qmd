FULL QUOTE UPCOMING Openscapes has really helped me think about science
differently, it's more collaborative and less lonely, with so many
people in open science as infinite ways to learn...

\

Ileana Fenwick
:::

::: notes
I love this quote from Ileana Fenwick, who says “Openscapes has been transformative for me as a scientist, as a team leader, and for our program…it has highlighted how much we can learn from each other, not just related to whatever project or issue we're working on, but also related to how we work. And it's created a forum for us to learn and share across programs and divisions.” (PLACEHOLDER)

Ileana is a marine scientist who was mentored through Openscapes and is now seeing new ways to support Black researchers through open science. This kind of experience is such a powerful example of paying things forward, connecting and extending
dots. 

transition: And this kind of reimagining and leadership is so critical today -

To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape
society. We need every solution and every solver. As the saying goes, to
change everything, we need everyone. **What this moment calls for is a
mosaic of voices** -- the full spectrum of idea and insights for how we
can turn things around.\

*All We Can Save*
:::

::: notes
Because this work is part of addressing the climate emergency. We take so much inspiration from groups like All We
Can Save, who say "To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape
society. We need every solution and every solver. As the saying goes, to
change everything, we need everyone. What this moment calls for is a
mosaic of voices the full spectrum of idea and insights for how we
can turn things around."

I find this quote so empowering because I want to be part of that mosaic of voices. It's not saying that Openscapes and Quarto are going to save us, but we can play a meaningful role in contributing to this greater effort.

Openscapes is contributing to a culture shift, and Quarto is enabling and accelerating it. 

This Openscapes Approach Guide is one small example. This Guide has no code in it, but we're using Quarto because it is gives us a really nimble way to write and publish.  Additionally, it role models how non-code contributions are really important in these large-scale cultural shifts. 

This was a place to write things down and share them, and really make the implicit explicit, first so that we consistent in how we work but also to welcome others to our approach, whether they're learning from us or on their own. 

I've talked a lot about NASA already but we've also been working with Mentors from NOAA Fisheries and the Cal EPA, as well as growing our team. This guide was a good way to onboard them, and to help them be not only learners but also contributors. They all had contributions they could make as new learners, no matter where they were starting from. We were able to onboard them to Quarto so that they could contribute early expertise and perspectives that could improve. 
(similar to ggplot?)

And it's also a way to amplify good ideas. We borrowed this idea from what we saw from other open source activities, particularly in the R and Mozilla communities. 

And Quarto has let us scale this mosaic of voices and make these ideas
actionable in a variety of ways.

**TO DO: Low priority - animate these to come on automatically one by one**

::: notes
This is a cool way to think about a mosaic of voices - both the voices combined within invidual quarto sites and across. And it represents so many different ways of contributing, whether with code or not. 

Through our work we've found again and again the importance of **space and place**: space for a mosaic of voices to come together and learn and share and find the common, and really transition behavior in a way that can be intimidating. And place where they can write things down, collaborate and share in really streamlined ways. Together this helps people feel less stuck, not assume skills in each other learn new skills, get comfortable sharing work earlier, and braver about sharing imperfect work -- which is critical to do to find climate solutions, since we need to iterate early 

~This is about not assuming technical skills, but about building trust and psychologically safety within teams, so that we can have honest conversations about what people know and where they need support upskilling. so that there is a strong culture of peer-learning and teaching, of asking questions, not assuming what people know or don't know, and trying to blur the lines of who can participate in technology.~

culture where they can say what they don't know and reinforce a
peer-learning & teaching culture, and using tooling that is friendly for
new and seasoned coders alike.

one thing that facilitates this kind of blurred lines between as a coder or not is the visual editor

And one way the mosiac of voices is enabled is through VE

Don't mean to say that the VE is only for new learners. It is for
markdown-savvy writers as well. In fact I know J.J. Allaire prefers to
do his writing in the VE.

Quarto enables collaborating across coding comfort levels and also different comfort levels with technology. It's been really neat to see how Quarto can not only reduce barriers across coding languages like python and R, but also
differnt experience levels.

Reimagine who participates. The VE is really friendly for non-coders, and is a nice way to write for markdown-savvy writers, and it's awesome to have a tool that both of those are true! And like Mine said, it gives space for learners to level-up

**Reimagine what contributing looks like and how we value it**

\

**Contribution formats:** interoperate with leverage the open web

\

**Science communication:** share earlier and as you want, openly

\

**Open as a way to work:** not just products but process and people

\

***Who*** **contributes:** who is psychologically safe and supported
:::

::: notes
And, maybe most importantly, we can all enable reimagining by reducing barriers, blurring lines. 

We can reimagine what contributing looks like, and how we value it. This starts with leveraging tools and approaches to support diverse contributors. 

With Openscapes and Quarto we've seen lines blurred between and across fed agencies, between researchers, between people who do and don't identify as coders, what lang you use, how technical you
are

See across levels of "finish". sharing imperfect work - the way that we
work, the softwared the workflows they've learned to use

Sharing openly, quickly, imperfectly - by bringinging together our way
of working with Quarto, supporing mentors that are more rapid sharers.
(tie to climate emergency and quarto) Quarto is theProduct/place, for
our process, people

Contributing openly as a way to work + removing barriers

We had the people and the process but we didn't have the place. When
Quarto snapped into place, we were able to reimagine how we work
togethre.

Growing the mosaic. meeting people where they were

So to close with this final quote from All We Can Save that we cannot, we must not, go it alone.

There's so much more to contribute, so much more to do. 

I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. Looking forward to this collective community to continue to contribute to this mosiac
