Over the last decade I have thoroughly loved teaching R Markdown.
It's amazing when students hit that Knit button, see their code and their prose come together -- you can often hear a "wow, that's so cool" in the classroom the first time that happens.
I've also loved that this is a tool that they can pick up easily on the first day of an intro course, and it grows with them as their statistical and computational expertise grows.
However, I have also struggled with students, and frankly, myself, when going from a single, simple document to all the various, more advanced output formats in the R Markdown ecosystem particularly for computationally heavy projects.
A pleasant surprise in teaching with Quarto has been how much less steep the learning curve is for going from a single, simple document to a multi-document project has been for students.

Last semester I had an art history student, Holland Stam, working on a pretty quantitative research project.
Her thesis explored the representation of artists from different genders and ethinicities in foundational art history books and how this representation has changed, if at all, through editions.
If you've ever taken an art history course you might be familiar with them: Garner's Art Through The Ages and Janson's History of Art.
She meticulously collected data from numerous editions of each of the textbooks and measured, page by page, how much space each featured artwork was given and joined that with demographic information on the artists.
When I met Holland in my regression course she had only one semester of data science as a background, where she learned R Markdown, and then she started using Quarto as part of coursework in my class.
The course assignments were done in single Quarto documents but she was able to figure out, with a bit of Googling and a bit of my help, that she can write each of her thesis chapters as a Quarto document, bring them together with a yml file, and voila!
You have a thesis written in Quarto.
And when she saw that using this approach she could caption her figures ande insert citations without manual text styling, she was sold!
It is always so heartwarming to see your students push what you're teaching them and use them to solve their problems, it's especially heartening when this happens with a new thing you're teaching for the first time while the thing is still in active development!
And, by the way, if you're interested in the data, Holland and another student of my, Sara, packaged it up as "arthistory" and you can find it on CRAN. [SAY A BIT MORE!]

But, back to Quarto... like for Holland, Quarto has provided simple but effective solutions for so many of my problems as an instructor as well.
Instead of telling you about them, let me show you!

-   Features that are useful for learning:
    -   yaml errors
    -   going from a handful of documents to book / thesis
    -   if teaching with rstudio, it comes with everything, and people can just get started
    -   visual editor -- Julie will say more
-   Features that are useful for teaching:
    -   chalkboard on slides
    -   multiplex: Slides / scroll for audience

    -   quarto publish quartopub
-   Features that are useful for research: quarto journal

## Quarto flattens the learning curve {.takeaway .center}

::: notes
A very pleasant surprise in teaching with Quarto has been how much flatter the learning curve is for leveling up from making a single document to creating multi-document projects.
This is aided by features like a consistent citation syntax, more intentional control over when computations should run or rerun, and a single, minimal yaml that controls inputs, layouts, theming, etc.

And beyond learners growing and expanding the scope of their work easily with Quarto, Quarto can grow with them in a profound way as well.
The fact that Quarto is language and authoring tool independent offers an opportunity for folks to take Quarto with them on their data science journey, wherever that journey takes them.
I mean..
I'm almost tempted to finally learn Python to see Python in action in Quarto.
But who I know is learning Python, and Julia, and other languages are my students in their Computer Science courses.
To think that they could learn R in RStudio, and using Quarto, in my course and then use Quarto again in a Jupyter Notebook in their Python course from CS... That sounds like such a bright future to me!

\[Pause\] And a bright future includes things we can't even imagine yet.
Julie will now tell us a bit about reimagining with Quarto?
