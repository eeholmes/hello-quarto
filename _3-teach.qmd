## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row. Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.

-   Teaching: Course website with obvious folders
-   Writing: Book - R4DS
-   Research: Journal articles

## Demo: File architecture, books

**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `# Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

Visual Editor: Mine's "this functionality exists" vs Julie's "this is designed to be inviting"

Quarto makes moving between "things" ~~easy~~ straightforward

::: notes
Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is straightforward:

-   Is teaching Quarto different from teaching R Markdown? Easier / harder / **not different**?
-   Potential anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve...
