Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is straightforward,<br> for experienced users and well as for new learners

Earlier I mentioned that Quarto makes moving between things straightforward, referring to various output formats as the "things".
An important question around "moving from one thing to another" that you might be wondering about is moving from teaching and learning R Markdown to Quarto as well as moving from teaching with R Markdown to Quarto.
This past year I taught a regression class with 90 students, where a large majority had taken an introductory data science course previously where they learned R Markdown. For just one semester. And then we dropped them into a course that used Quarto instead, with a brief overview of the differences, like YAML style chunk options and rendering instead of knitting. And then we just let them run with it. And the transition was incredibly smooth for all students in the class. Not one mention of "why Quarto when we already learned R Markdown" in the evaluations, which, frankly, was a pleasant surprise to me.
<>So, moving from R Markdown to Quarto is straightforward, for experienced users and well as for new learners.
There are, of course, big differences technically between these two systems. However practically, for students who are just writing a single document for a given assignment and maybe an end of semester project with a handful of chapters, teaching and learning Quarto is practically not different than R Markdown.
What is different, however, is the learning curve that comes after it.

## Learning curve...

- With Quarto simple quarto -> more complicated is not hard
- With Rmd -> look at the power of what rmd did with a simple document, ecosystem florishing creates lack of consistency, quarto is unifying -- rmd common thread but also lots of domain specific, lots of stuff to pick up in between, 10000ft view, distill in a common core
- rmd a lot of pieces, quarto bringing things together, and featuring visual editor helps
- really loved teaching rmd but quarto people are picking it up a lot more quickly
-  Anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve.

- Features that are useful for learning:
  - yaml errors
  - going from a handful of documents to book / thesis
  - if teaching with rstudio, it comes with everything, and people can just get started
  - visual editor -- Julie will say more
- Features that are useful for teaching:
  - chalkboard on slides
  - multiplex: Slides / scroll for audience
  - downlit / code-link
  - quarto publish quartopub
- Features that are useful for research: quarto journal

## Quarto can grow with learners in a profound way {.takeaway .center}

- Not just easy to go from document -> thesis -> book or website
- Not just easy to go from simple documents -> meticulously formatted journal articles
- But also across disciplines -- stats students using Jupyter in CS class can use Quarto too, maybe? That sounds like a bright future to me!
