Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have both been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching with it since its earliest days and my Openscapes team is the first external users of Quarto. As Mine and I have experimented with it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

# Hello, Quarto? {.title-top-light background-image="images/horst-quarto-meteor-transparent.png" aria-label="Quarto logo depicted as a meteor against a white background with a tail comprised of bright stars."}

::: notes
But also, we know you have questions. Mine and I did too. What is Quarto? Why Quarto? And how does it relate to R Markdown and to other tools you already use and workflows you already have? \<\> Well -

:::

::: notes
It unifies it for people who love R Markdown by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends it for people who don't know RMarkdown by being a friendly way to work reproducibly with text and code in the same place

The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.

\<\> It handles inputs in multiple languages, and outputs in multiple formats, all going through the same machinery.

\<\> In our talk today, we'll introduce you to Quarto with stories and demos.

Mine: with the last one, and you too can be a part of this change. We've talked about our experiences using Quarto and all the problems it has helped us solve and reimagine, but while Quarto is stable and ready for use, it's also just a baby that you too can be a part of its growth. So start using and start chiming in with feedback... or build an extension...
