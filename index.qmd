# Hello, Quarto?

Julie: But also, we know you have questions. As long-time RMarkdown users, Mine and I did too. What is Quarto? Why Quarto? And how does it relate to RMarkdown and to other tools you already use and workflows you already have? Transition: Well -

It unifies the RMarkdown ecosystem by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends the RMarkdown ecosystem as a friendly way for code and text to be published in the same place with tools that interoperates with how they already work.

Julie: Quarto is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better. It handles inputs in multiple languages, and outputs in multiple formats, all going through the same machinery.

The interplay of how tools influence culture and vice versa is really exciting to me here: there is a really strong culture of reuse and teaching in the R community that has been driven by RMarkdown and excited to interoperate with other languages too

Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year. I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke. The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching. Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles. Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation. More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well. So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## Next generation R Markdown

![](images/rmd-to-quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Mine: Julie mentioned it unified so let's dig a bit more into what that means... It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem. Beyond unification, Quarto also makes available attractive and handy features like tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc. consistently across the various outputs.

    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*

:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving between formats within Quarto is straightforward

-   Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website)
-   It's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

::: notes
Julie: This is what this movement looks like. We think of open science as this beautiful landscape full of data, tools and community, with many existing paths forward. But it can be out-of-view for many researchers who are isolated and siloed and struggling to work with data and software in meaningful ways.

Openscapes helps researchers move from lonely science like the animals on bottom left and identify what their trailhead looks like so they explore and navigate this landscape together.

We've now mentored over 75 research teams to take steps together, most who like me have been marine scientists who use R.\

Transition: This is one example of the impact for researchers -

::: notes
Erin Robinson joined Openscapes as my partner as we found each other and recognized a shared vision for the Openscapes movement and supporting researchers to make true change. Our story starts with bringing NASA and Openscapes together. And Erin had worked with NASA for 15 years and saw that could apply the Openscapes approach to a big effort with NASA Earthdata.

### The New Cloud Paradigm

**Researchers will move their compute to the Cloud.**

**NASA staff collaborate across Data Centers to support.**

::: notes
NASA Earthdata is migrating to the Cloud. This has been a tremendous effort over years from all corners of NASA.

Traditionally, these data are stored by 12 different data centers and researchers download the data in order to analyze it locally.

The new paradigm is Researchers will move their compute to the Cloud, which requires much more programmatic access rather than map- and menu-based access.

It also means that NASA staff needs to collaborate across Data Centers to support researchers with best practices for open data science.

And this is where Erin saw Openscapes comes in.

::: notes
Our NASA-Openscapes project is to develop a cross-data center Mentor community to create and teach a common set of Earthdata tutorials that Mentors iterate for specific research examples.

Over the last year we've worked with just amazing group of NASA user support staff and engineers we've started onboarding a second year to this group as well.

Our work started with on finding the common needs across all Mentors, creating a peer-learning and teaching culture, and having them contribute to shared activities as part of their jobs.

As you'll see, this group has acheived so much in the last year. And it really speaks to the importance of both leadership support which we've been so grateful to have across many levels of NASA, as well as empowered early adopters that can connect and grow

So this is a big project. And a lot of it was new to me. While Erin had a decade of experience with the NASA community, I was unfamiliar with Earth science as a research domain, the types of satellite imagery data NASA works with, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly.

# NASA Earth scientists use python ðŸ˜¬

Quarto enables us to collab across coding languages. We could use Quarto in a way that I was familiar with through RMarkdown, but include all different filetypes like you see here. Quarto has been fundamental to us collaborating across languages.
:::

## Screenshot: RStudio IDE, VSCode, Jupyter...

-   Mention: You install Quarto with a CLI, (like git) so you can work with whatever tooling you want

::: notes
And part of that is that we can all use the tools we're comfortable with as we contribute. So we could focus on upskilling around common pieces like Quarto and GitHub, but we didn't need to upset or shift everyone's software workflows, we could weave Quarto into existing workflows.

And this has also have dividends because while I said that the Earth science community is python-heavy what we've learned the more we work with this NASA Cloud data we see there is a significant R community and we're positioned to support them with this workflow we've developed because of Quarto it's not language-specific

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

Urgent need to welcome more people
:::

#  (quarto)

::: notes
With Openscapes, Quarto is helping us get to places in reimagined ways. it's helped us welcome more people to transitions that can be intimidating

. I talked before about how it's removed barriers for people across coding languages to collaborate, but as we reimagine what's possible Quarto's role is removing barriers of different coding comfort levels.

So I wanted to tell you a **story emphasizing how to build inclusion into your daily work**
:::

## Make the implicit explicit

*Build inclusion into your daily work*

<br>

::: columns

I got an email just yesterday that said 'I can tell the lab is a friendly, engaging, and positive learning environment'" - Dr. Gavin Fay, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth
:::
:::

::: notes
One of the ways you welcome people is making the implicit explicit

Writing things down is a way to build inclusion, so that there's not hidden curriculum or and that you don't assume what people know and are comfortable with

Gavin Fay's lab at UMass Dartmouth was mentored through Openscapes adn they then went and wrote a public lab manual that puts their values forward. This was a way to builds trust and psych safety, which has built resilience in his teams, and was particuarly important as they had new members join their lab remotely during the Pandemic.

Transition:

\~Another benefit too is that it reduces emails bc often instead of asking questions people know to look in the lab manual, and when there are questions that aren't covered there, they are added to this shared resource rather than being lost in an email thread with two people. (Point people to where it lives - remember that our expectations for how we run our meetings is documented here) (lab-chat repo culture)\~

:::

::: notes
Something they did to help welcome new lab members was to onboard them as learners and contributors. This meant slowing down to speed up, and was a nice long-term way to maintain the documentation and the community at the same time.

And their approach evolved. First it was "if you find something broken let us know" and the it was "let's teach you how to fix it together.

Since new learners were often contributing from the browser, they also set up a GitHub Action so it's published immediately when someone contributes. That reminds me of the philosophy of teaching ggplot early, so that new contributors can see their change integrated straight away and feel excited about their accomplishments.

## Reuse (and credit!) good ideas

::: notes
The next part of this story is to reuse good ideas. We loved how the FayLab made the implict explicit and brought that idea to NASA.

As we were first dev'ing our Mentor community, there wasn't a place to make the implicit explicit. Quarto gave them that place - we put it as the contributor place right in the cookbook.

Catalina has said how Quarto has given her a place to share ideas earlier, comfortable sharing imperfect work and getting feedback

\~16:06:34 there's supporting researchers who are in this transition too, and quarto, you know, gave us a place and a space to make it explicit. 16:06:50 What was common, and you know and it's positioned us that we're not language specific.\~

::: notes
Having gotten familiar with a collaborative workflow with Quarto, the Mentors then turned around and reused not only the tutorials they developed but the structure and presentation, in order to create Quarto sites for specific learning events they led together.

They got familiar with each other's work, they gave feedback, and when there was an emergency for one of the teachers the morning of the first workshop others were confidently able to step in to lead, since they were familiar with where everything was, how it worked, and how they had seen it taught. So building with intention and reusing rather reinventing builds resilience in teams and people
