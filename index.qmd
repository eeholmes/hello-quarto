## Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem

A new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.

Julie: Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem. It builds on 10 years of insight from RMarkdown
It's a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.
-   Inputs in multiple languages
-   Outputs in multiple formats
-   All going through the same machinery

Older notes:
-   Extends: doesn't have a dependency or requirement for R; developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia, with the idea that it will work even for languages that don't yet exist.

-   Extends: Has more "guardrails" for users - accessibility and inclusion centered in the design (Mara)

Quarto combines the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system with "batteries included" that reflects everything we've learned from R Markdown over the past 10 years. In addition, many new features are available including extensions for cross-references, figure panels, callouts, advanced page layout, and more. While it is a "new" system, it should also be noted that it is highly compatible with existing content: you can render most R Markdown documents and Jupyter notebooks unmodified with Quarto. J.J. will discuss the philosophy and design of the system, demonstrate its capabilities, and talk about future directions for development.

::: aside
Julie: We'll introduce Quarto to you in four acts: share, collaborate, teach, reimagine. Mine will talk about left side, focused on stories from people who love RMarkdown (starting with herself!). I'll talk about right side, focused on stories from people who do not know RMarkdown. Both: share demos and stories.

# Share

## PROPOSAL: Mine and her work (a few slides)

(maybe a photo of you?)

I'm a professor, teacher, and creator...

I share everything openly

(open science intro here? maybe focused on open artifacts (and Julie could reiterate, focused on open practice (~slide 35)))

## Next generation R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration:** Many "down" hex logos on one side, Quarto logo and some indication of other languages on the other side.
:::

-   5 or 6 things that were in diff formats

-   Side-by-side with quarto vs Rmd

    -   Enumerage: tabsets, code-folding, highlighting.¬†

::: aside
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a \_quarto.yml, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors
:::

## Knit vs render?

-   Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc: Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: aside
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is easy\* {.small}

*\*but don't call things "easy", need a better adjective...*

Teaching: creating materials and teaching the tools

-   Moving between formats within Quarto is easy: Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website) and it's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)
-   Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is easy
    -   Is teaching Quarto different from teaching R Markdown? Easier / harder / **not different**?
    -   Potential anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve...

::: aside
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

I'm a marine ecologist > data scientist > open science champion

rstats changed my life - Better science in less time (we learned the hard way), Kinder science

Long-time RMarkdown user - I launched Openscapes with RMarkdown  (blogdown website, bookdown curriculum, distill blog events page). Out of the box!

Mozilla, UCSB?

## Openscapes

We mentor research teams to transition to inclusive open data science workflows

We've worked with 70+ teams 

maybe logos of groups we've worked with?

::: notes
My partner Erin Robinson and I built Openscapes - I launched it in 2018 and Erin brought the plan for scaling and sustainability, and together we‚Äôve radically iterated and rapidly tested and disrupted. We have a shared vision for supporting research teams

# Openscapes \<\> Quarto story begins with NASA

üöÄüåè

<br>
[NASA-Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io): helping researchers using NASA Earthdata transition analytical workflows to the Cloud

::: notes
Julie: The Openscapes Quarto story begins with NASA. This was our first project with Erina nd me, Erin comes from the NASA community, connected Openscapes approach with needs she knew at NASA
Remotely-sensed satellite imagery used to track pollution, agriculture, etc. Very different data and challenges
Earth science community is heavily Python oriented
And you'll notice that I'm an R user not Python, and I'm not Earth Science
I won't lie, I was super intimidated, feeling like I was out of my league. Like a fish out of water, and specifically, in outerspace. 

The nicest people - zoom picture? But a lot of new-ness, scary. 
:::

## But I had a secret

My life had been changed by RMarkdown

Experience and confidence built up over years

## Quarto let me bring my secret to Python/NASA 

Collaborating with J.J., we were I believe the first external testers

Quarto dev team support

NASA Mentors saw it and were willing to go for it (growth mindset)

::: notes
Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made, started in spring 2021. It's beautiful. Automatic beautiful TOC on the right side

Streamlines teamwork: we came together from across silos, with different skills, comfort with coding, different coding language, different tech. Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

I want to talk about streamlining teamwork in 2 ways: interoperating with tech, and interoperating with people.

# Teach

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Quarto logo with one quadrant showing the words "Quarto enables new ways of sharing & organization" and the others grayed out.
:::

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: aside
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)
:::

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row. Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.

-   Teaching: Course website with obvious folders
-   Writing: Book - R4DS

## DEMO: File architecture, books

**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `# Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

::: notes
Julie: What Mine just showed was really powerful for me - once I saw what I could do for my current needs, I saw new ways to reuse and reimagine future ideas. I built Openscapes because of what what I saw was possible with RMarkdown, and it has only increased and extended because of Quarto. Let me tell you about Openscapes, and what our work looks like day to day
:::

## Reimagining science

beyond publications, beyond code & data: websites, blogs, shiny apps...

beyond silos, domains, borders, languages: sharing, collaboration...

open web...

culture change

actionable change (stories/example)

::: notes
Julie:
:::

## Open science as a movement

-   (It's about products (access to data, code, publications))

-   It's about process. Workflows. People. Daily habits. Culture. Open source tooling.

-   [Open software means kinder science](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/) (Lowndes 2019, Scientific American)

It's the way science should be done, but who can participate? Both from a tech and culture perspective

Hugely inspired by Climate Justice, Get Out the Vote movements, rOpenSci, RStudio, RLadies, Mozilla

Urgency. why this matters. Collaborate with people sooner, co-create/reuse not reinvent. Connect the skills to the values with the urgency.

::: notes
if you are already into open science, open source tools like Quarto helps you execute open science. And if you're not already into open science, open source tools like Quarto can be an entryway and motivator to get engaged

There's more emphasis on open science and this is the way science should be done. All these things about open up your process \> one of the challenges have been tools that allow you to easily do these things the things. These allow you to do thie
:::


## We've been learning a lot through helping teams reimagine

Important for new & seasoned coders, and folks who don't identify as coders.

Learning new tech is about behavior change, culture change

Reducing friction so folks focus their time on their work/science: less reinventing 

Quarto really helps underscore these points: Tooling and culture  

(set stories up for visual editor demo)

## Create space

Necessary part of reimagining: Time.

Learning culture. Inclusion, psychological safety, trust. Empathy. Growth Mindset.

Don't need to have a plan, just you want to do better. make the space.

Takes time to learn and do, amazing what folks can do together. Across backgrounds, skills, expertise.

Managers at NASA, NOAA, faculty at universities. Supporting people's time to learn. open science must be part of people's paid work.

NOAA Cohort right now with 9 Supervisors participating.

::: aside
Julie: Culture of trust, less reinventing. Meets someone like me where they are and supports them. (Revisit from useR) Not necessarily for existing/experienced users to change their ways but to create an opportunity for including others...

-   Mara: Quarto has more "guardrails" for users - more friendly for sometone who hasn't worked in this environment before \> maybe up in the visual editor part/

::: aside
Visual Editor: Mine's "this functionality exists" vs Julie's "this is designed to be inviting"

Julie: So excited to be here. I am a long-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults.
