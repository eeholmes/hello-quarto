# Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have both been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching with it since its earliest days and my Openscapes team is the first external users of Quarto. As Mine and I have experimented with it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

# Hello, Quarto?

Julie: But also, we know you have questions.
We did too.
What is Quarto?
Why Quarto?
And how does it relate to RMarkdown and to other tools you already use and workflows you already have?

::: notes
It unifies the RMarkdown ecosystem by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends the RMarkdown ecosystem as a friendly way for code and text to be published in the same place with tools that interoperates with how they already work.

Transition: It builds on 10 years of insight from RMarkdown -

::: notes
Julie: Quarto is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system.
The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.
It handles inputs in multiple languages, and outputs in multiple formats, all going through the same machinery.

The interplay of how tools influence culture and vice versa is really exciting to me here: there is a really strong culture of reuse and teaching in the R community that has been driven by RMarkdown and excited to interoperate with other languages too

Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year.
I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke.
The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching.
Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles.
Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation.
More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well.
So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## Next generation R Markdown

![](images/rmd-to-quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Mine: Julie mentioned it unified so let's dig a bit more into what that means... It combines/unifies some "down" packages.
It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
Beyond unification, Quarto also makes available attractive and handy features like tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc. consistently across the various outputs.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors

## Knit vs render?

-   Rmd -\> knitr -\> pandoc: R package (rmarkdown) doing the orchestration
-   Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc: Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving between formats within Quarto is straightforward

-   Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website)
-   It's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books).
Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code.
This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

Julie: I am a squid scientist by training, and I work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science.
What I absolutely love doing is mentoring, teaching, and empowering communities.

I've made this my job through Openscapes.
I've been able to find this intersection and nurture this passion through so many mentors and colleagues who I value so much.
(if you want more backstory you can see this talk, link.)

And Openscapes aims to provide a welcome for other teams to do the same.

::: notes
Julie: This is what the movement looks like.
We think of open science as this beautiful landscape full of tools and community, with many paths forward.
But it can be out-of-view for many researchers, who are siloed and struggling to work with data and software in a meaningful way.

We help researchers move from lonely science like the animals on bottom left isolated scientist see themselves as part of their team and explore this landscape together.

We've now helped 11 cohorts and 75 teams take steps together, most who have been marine science teams who use R.\

Transition: This is one example of an outcome of that -

OR?

Through Openscapes I learned I wasn't alone and found commonalities with my team.
I'm able to code collaborative with my own team more efficiently, I just helped another team since my code is on GitHub!

With Erin, with NASA

::: notes
Helping people find their their team is a big focus of Openscapes.
And I needed a team too.
Erin Robinson joined Openscapes as my partner and our story starts with bringing NASA and Openscapes together.
We had a shared vision for the Openscapes movement and supporting researchers to make true change.
And Erin had worked with NASA for 15 years and saw that could apply the Openscapes approach to a big effort with NASA Earthdata.

### New Cloud Paradigm

::: notes
NASA Earthdata is migrating to the Cloud.
This has been a tremendous effort over years from all corners of NASA.

Traditionally, these data are stored by 12 different data centers and researchers download the data in order to analyze it locally.

The new paradigm is Researchers will move their compute to the Cloud, which requires much more programmatic access rather than map- and menu-based access.

It also means that NASA staff needs to collaborate across Data Centers to support researchers with best practices for open data science.

And this is where Erin saw Openscapes comes in.

::: notes
Our NASA-Openscapes project is to develop a cross-data center Mentor community to create and teach a common set of Earthdata tutorials that Mentors iterate for specific science examples.

Over the last year we've worked with just amazing engineers and user support staff to learn and co-create this together.

We've focused on finding the common needs across all Mentors, creating a teaching culture, and having them contribute to shared resources as part of their jobs.
On that note thank managers and leadership from all different levels of NASA who have supported their staff in making this transition themselves.

We've done a lot in the last year.
But in those early days, this was all very new and intimidating to me.
While Erin has been a part of the NASA community for the last decade, I was unfamiliar with Earth science as a research domain, the types of data NASA works with, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly.
Transition: And a fourth big thing that was challenging -
:::

# NASA Earth scientists use python ðŸ˜¬

::: notes
NASA Earth scientists largely use python.
And jupyter notebooks.
This was a new world to me that we needed to figure out how to navigate.
Erin and my role was not to learn python from the ground up, we but we needed to be able to support teams of python users and advise them and interoperate with them.
This was really intimidating to me.

::: notes
Quarto enables us to collab across coding languages.
We could use Quarto in a way that I was familiar with through RMarkdown, but include all different filetypes like you see here.
This kind of language compatibility really helped us collaborate across languages.

And this has also have dividends because while I said that the Earth science community is python-heavy what we've learned the more we work with researcher teams and Mentors is that there is a significant R community and we're set up to support them in the same place because of Quarto

Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

So let me show you what this looks like in Jupyter -

-   `quarto convert` to .qmd
-   Open in VS Code, show `.qmd` (cmd-shift-k to render \[attention to other tool chains available\])

# Teach

![](images/quadrants-teach.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices.
Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output.
(Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `# Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is straightforward:

-   Is teaching Quarto different from teaching R Markdown? Easier / harder / **not different**?
-   Potential anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve...

I am a long-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults.

But a lot of us feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view.
Through the Champions program we will help you explore and navigate these pathways; you'll find common approaches with your team as you identify your trailhead and safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as you go.
We mentor and developed and have iterated a whole flywheel for culture change

## Quarto enables interoperability and collaboration

Streamlines teamwork

-   shared vision: code and text together beautifully
-   interoperability with tech
-   interoperability with people

I launched Openscapes to help research teams transition to inclusive open data science workflows.
This started as first only the Champions Program where we mentor research teams

We've worked with 70+ teams

And what we're doing is said beautifully by Dr. Adyan Rios

But when Erin Robinson joined Openscapes she brought expertise in scaling programs and making them sustainable.
She introduced this idea of the Flywheel of the steps needed to really create lasting culture change.

It involves focusing beyond delivering the Champions program; and how there is a whole series of steps that interplay...

Transition - we've worked with 70+ research teams, and what this looks like for them is said beautifully by Dr. Adyan Rios:

## Create space

Prioritize time.

Build trust, psychological safety, inclusion

Ask how people work, where they're stuck, what they know.

Foster a learning culture.
And a teaching culture.
Empathy.
Growth Mindset.
Meet people where they are.

Learning.
messy.
Don't need to have a plan, just you want to do better.
make the space.
Takes time to learn and do, amazing what folks can do together.
Across backgrounds, skills, expertise.

Managers at NASA, NOAA, faculty at universities.
Supporting people's time to learn.
open science must be part of people's paid work.

NOAA Cohort right now with 9 Supervisors participating.

Necessary part of reimagining: Time.
:::

::: notes
This might be dated now 1.
Share your ideas earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture 2.
Reuse: create-once-use-often.
less reinventing; focus your time on the science.
3.
bring inclusion into your daily work (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs

## Create place

Quarto has been really key for us with NASA Openscapes (also JupyterHub, GitHub, Google Docs)

Where we put things, what contributing looks like

Reuse: Create-once-use-often.

## Share ideas earlier

not limited to a final publication

As we were getting started, knew we could share as we built out the idea

## Make the implicit explicit

Make the implicit explicit - writing things down

**Build inclusion into your daily work** - onboarding

## Openscapes Approach {.smaller}

![](images/horst_pew_tools_practice_mindset.jpg){fig-align="left" width="50%"}

::: {.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width="520"}
-   **Researcher-centered, focused on teams.** Practice and feel safe working openly with yourself and your team; then ease into more.

-   **Create space & place to explore & learn.** Cohort Calls, Seaside Chats, Co-Working; GitHub, R, Python, Quarto, Google Drive, Slack; Efficiency & Inclusion Tips.

-   **Cultivate relationships & real connections.** Welcoming folks w/ diverse backgrounds; meeting where they are; skills to empower immediate work; kinder science.

-   **Open culture: Learning, teaching, iterating.** Not a checklist - a continual practice.
    Imperfect, messy.
    Takes time.

::: notes
TODO We mentor teams We mentor environmental and Earth science teams government, non-profit, and academic groups Openscapes is about better science for future us.
We help teams transition to inclusive open science workflows This is visualized: We mentor teams to better tackle their questions by modernizing shared practices, underpinned by existing tools.

-   Mentor, facilitator, teacher, coach, community organizer

-   Project lead, tech infrastructure setup

-   Merger (and creator) of merge conflicts

-   Open source advocate

-   Researcher advocate

Julie: We mentor teams We create a learning culture, break down silos and loneliness creating space - people; creating place - tech **Better science for future us**

For reimagining habits and culture change

Openscapes helps research teams Collab around data.
Tech diffs, experience.
Inclusion, behavior change.

Called open science (like nmfs intro)

Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together.
Our main focus is to empower research teams.
A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view.
We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.

4.  Freeze \> blog posts, jupyter notebooks

5.  Each book chapter starting in a fresh session opening as you'd expect them to

6.  Table \> 2 tables next to each other

7.  Table in the margin

8.  Chalkboard on slides

9.  multiplex: Slides / scroll for audience

10. Downlit (link directly to mutate function documentation pkgdown)

11. Include xaringan slides in Quarto project with resources

12. `quarto publish`

Julie: summary slide and transition

Reprise from NASA Openscapes - find the common - reuse existing - contribute to fill gaps - foster a learning culture

We've spent a lot of time over these past years thinking of how can reimagine.
Here is what i'm brining into the space of Quarto.
Here are 3 things where Q helps LIZ trying to map the bullets to the green ring.
, trying to shoehorn these list into those topics, not the best way to think about these ideas in concert with each other A lot going on on one slide.

one way of inclusion is making opps for contributing while learning Prioritizing and clarity.
Every choice is deliberate.
Designed.
