# Setup

## Setup

-   This section contains some setup information to be used during the preparation of the talk
-   Will be removed before finalizing the talk

## Color palette

Tested for six common types of color blindness.

```{r}
#| label: load-pkg
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| out.width: "100%"

df <- tribble(
  ~color,    ~name,                   ~text_color, 
  "#FF744E", "OPENSCAPES ORANGE",           "black",
  "#FAE3E3", "MISTY ROSE",            "black",
  "#607576", "CADET",                 "black",
  "#1C1C1C", "EERIE BLACK",           "white",
  "#75AADB", "QUARTO BLUE",           "black"
)

ggplot(df, aes(y = fct_inorder(color), x = 10, fill = color)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  theme_void() +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1, label = paste(color, "-", name), color = text_color), hjust = 0, fontface = "bold") +
  scale_color_identity()
```

# Talk

## Hi, I'm Julie

*Unpolished ideas:*

-   I'm a marine ecologist turned open data science champion: I lead Openscapes to help teams migrate to collaborative workflows.
-   I am a prolific RMarkdown and Quarto user, but not a pro user
-   Theme: collaborating

## Quarto helps you reimagine, collaborate, and share

Mine: will talk about left side

Julie: will talk about right side; Both: share demos, stories, FAQ's we've encountered so far
:::

## What is Quarto

**Quarto is something you can use if you love RMarkdown**

<br>

**Next generation R Markdown:**

-   It combines/unifies some "down" packages
-   It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (python, Julia). provides that functionality even if you're not coming from R ecosystem

::: aside
*Illustration: "down" hex logos*

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

*This slide will be replaced with a screen recording.*

::: demo
-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a \_quarto.yml, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
:::

::: aside
Mine:

## FAQ: knit vs render?

(this comes after changing the extension from .rmd to .qmd)

::: aside
*illustration: maybe a graphic and a arrow pointing at a high-level where it's different*

Mine:
:::

## FAQ: from Jenny or Jo?

## Story:

-   teaching background
-   teaching winter course - anectodote from art history student?
-   Why is this interesting, is it diff from teaching Rmd? easier, harder? Not different?

OR: diff formats within R (web, slides, course web) I go between the formats a lot (Rmd 8 ways)

Mine:

## What is Quarto

**Quarto is something you can use even if you've never used RMarkdown.**

*unpolished ideas:*

-   nicely-formatted code & text together to publish
-   organizing your work as collections: documentation, code, notebooks
-   collaborating framework (across R & Python, across coders and non-coders)

::: aside
Julie: will start off with a story, then demo

::: notes
Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together.
Our main focus is to empower research teams.
A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view.
We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.

## Creating "space & place"

Julie: Openscapes helps teams develop practices that are underpinned by tools.
Quarto creates "place"

## NASA Openscapes

Supporting scientific researcher teams using NASA Earthdata as they migrate their workflows to the cloud.

**Develop mentors • Empower research teams • Scale teaching**

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   find the common
-   reuse existing
-   contribute to fill gaps
-   foster a teaching/learning culture

## DEMO: Flexibility in the tooling

*This slide will be replaced with a screen recording.*

::: demo
-   Render Mine's example site in JupyterHub

-   Add `.ipynb` in example site

## Q&A - Quarto is a "philosophy" (and a document type)

From Allison Horst, Gavin

## Quarto enables new ways of sharing

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing

-   If it's not easy to make a course website, you won't
-   Tooling that makes it easy to share with the world
-   New way of getting credit
-   Open sharing of knowledge. Other people can just take
-   When it comes time for promotion/review, I say here it is
-   Last 10% to tweak it for your context

Mine:

## DEMO: Part 2

*This slide will be replaced with a screen recording.*

::: demo
-   visual editor

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto",

-   Now to be a bit more principled about the transition (Change extension .rmd to .qmd and render to see it's fine)

-   Change \_bookdown.yml to \_quarto.yml

-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `#Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC.
    change to yaml `title: Like This`.
    Also will look right in the viewer

## Quarto enables reuse & reimagining

-   create-once-use-often
-   less reinventing; focus your time on the science

## Fostering a culture of reuse

## Fostering a culture of reuse

Interoperability (language, tooling, people) --\>

Enabling collaborations, transferrable skills

## Demo / Showcase culture of reuse:

::: question
Is this going to be a screen recording as well?

## Closing

-   RMarkdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling \> culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages
