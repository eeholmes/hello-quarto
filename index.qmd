# Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have both been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching with it since its earliest days and my Openscapes team is the first external users of Quarto. As Mine and I have experimented with it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

# Hello, Quarto? {background-image="images/horst_quarto_telescope.png"}

::: notes
Julie: But also, we know you have questions.
As long-time RMarkdown users, Mine and I did too.
What is Quarto?
Why Quarto?
And how does it relate to RMarkdown and to other tools you already use and workflows you already have?
Transition: Well -

It unifies the RMarkdown ecosystem by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends the RMarkdown ecosystem as a friendly way for code and text to be published in the same place with tools that interoperate with how you already work.

Transition: It builds on 10 years of insight from RMarkdown -

::: notes
Julie: Quarto is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system.
The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.
It handles inputs in multiple languages, and outputs in multiple formats, all going through the same machinery.

The interplay of how tools influence culture and vice versa is really exciting to me here: there is a really strong culture of reuse and teaching in the R community that has been driven by RMarkdown and excited to interoperate with other languages too

Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year.
I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke.
The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching.
Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles.
Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation.
More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well.
So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## Next generation R Markdown

![](images/rmd-to-quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Mine: Julie mentioned it unified so let's dig a bit more into what that means... It combines/unifies some "down" packages.
It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
Beyond unification, Quarto also makes available attractive and handy features like tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc. consistently across the various outputs.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors

:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving between formats within Quarto is straightforward

-   Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website)
-   It's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books).
Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code.
This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

![](images/openscapes_hex.png){.absolute top="0" width="15%"}

::: notes
Openscapes is a movement and a community that I launched and have built together with my partner Erin Robinson.

Our flagship activity is mentoring research teams in environmental open data science. Since 2018 we've helped over 75 teams move from sad lonely workflows like the animals on bottom left and into this rich landscape full of open source software, data, and communities. Our role is welcome folks at the trailhead, meeting them where they are and helping them explore and navigate this landscape safely together.

A big focus of Openscapes is helping researchers build psychologically safety within their teams, so that there is a strong culture of peer-learning and teaching, of asking questions, not assuming what people know or don't know, and trying to blur the lines of who can participate in technology.

Transition: The story I'd like to tell you now is with NASA
:::

##  {background-video="images/R_beach_ball_flat_360p.mp4"}

::: notes
NASA has been collecting unbelievable amounts of data about Earth since 1960. These data are freely available and help researchers tackle really critical questions about our planet, which is only more relevant with the imapacts of climate change.

Historically, these data are stored by 12 different data centers around the US and researchers go to different data centers separately to download sometimes terrabytes of data to analyze it locally.

Transition - Now, as a result of many years of the preparation theyâ€™re migrating these data to the Cloud. In anticipation and support of this, those 12 data centers are gearing up to support researchers transition their workflows to the Cloud too. 
(maybe just say this or have a slide)

And this is how NASA Openscapes came to be

NASA-Openscapes is a 3-year project is to Develop a cross-NASA mentor community to co-create and teach common tutorials to support researchers with Earthdata Cloud

So this is a big project. Since we started in early 2021 we've been working with just amazing group of NASA user support staff and engineers. And while Erin had a decade of experience with the NASA community, a lot of it was new to me. I was unfamiliar with Earth science as a research domain, the types of satellite imagery data NASA works with, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly. 

Transition: And as an R user a fourth big thing that was intimidating to me -

::: notes
Many NASA Earth scientists use python, and that's where the tutorial development was focused. And my role leading NASA Openscapes was not to learn python from the ground-up, but I needed to be able to interoperate and collaborate with python users. 
Transition: So I was feeling pretty intimidated about this. But if you know me, you know that -

##  {background-image="images/horst_rey_quarto.png" background-size="85%"}

::: notes
I feel like R and especially RMarkdown is a total superpower, I honestly I think differently about what's possible in science because of RMarkdown. Quarto let me bring that experience and confidence to NASA Openscapes. 

I had been collaborating with J.J. Allaire for the past few years and I knew Quarto was emerging right when we needed it. I asked if we could use Quarto for NASA-Openscapes and this became a really exciting collaboration with the Quarto team and the NASA Mentors

## 
![](images/hackathon.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This Quarto site we made for the Fall 2021 Cloud Hackathon was where we really found traction in working together with the Mentors was dev'ing tutorials for the hackathon. 

Through Openscapes gave them space and they dev'd a community, psych safety, getting comfortable learning new things, sharing imperfect work,  giving feedback. And quarto gave them a place to collab and present their work on a beautiful way for learners.

::: notes
In fact, it's mostly .ipynbs as you see in this simplifid view of our `_quarto.yml` file.
Being able to make a collection of tutorials in different language and filetypes has been a huge benefit for us working together.
:::

## Contributing from our current tools {.julie}

Screenshot: RStudio IDE, VSCode, Jupyter...

::: notes
And, we're all able to work in whatever tool we're already comfortable with as we contributed to this cookbook, which is possible since you install quarto as a command line too like git; it's not an R package or a python package.
So with people working in their current tools and Quarto working in each case, we didn't need people to shift their software tools and instead could focus on upskilling around common pieces like Quarto and GitHub, but we didn't need to upset or shift everyone's software workflows, we could weave Quarto into existing workflows.

And this has also have dividends because while I said that the Earth science community is python-heavy what we've learned the more we work with this NASA Cloud data we see there is a significant R community and we're positioned to support them with this workflow we've developed because of Quarto it's not language-specific

NASA-Openscapes is a 3-year project is to Develop a cross-NASA mentor community to create & teach common Earthdata Cloud tutorials that are then iterated for specific research examples

Since we started in early 2021 we've worked with just amazing group of NASA user support staff and engineers.
We've supported them through finding the common needs across all Mentors, fostering a peer-learning and teaching culture, and having them contribute to shared activities as part of their jobs.
And along with our mentorship we've also provided a 2i2c JupyterHub, AWS Cloud Credits, and Carpentries Instructor training.

As you'll see, this group has achieved a lot in the last year.
And the successes of this project so far really speaks to the importance of leadership support plus empowered and connected early adopters.
We've been really thankful to have both this top-down and grassroots level of support

Transition: So this is a big project.
And while Erin had a decade of experience with the NASA community, when we started, a lot of it was new and frankly really intimidating to me.

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices.
Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output.
(Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

Making the mosaic of voices actionable has been a focus


With Openscapes and Quarto we've been able to help this mosaic of voices actionable. We've given space to build psychological safety and place to collaborate and share ideas. We've been helping people make transitions that can be intimidating.

Over the last year there have been all these voices: NOAA, NASA, Fay Lab - mosiac of all these little books. They've enabled engagement, they've empowered learners as contributors and mentors as contributors to co-teach. We've empowered and scaled this good ideas

Each of these were developed building from the last, reusing good idea, focused on specific learners and including more people

These groups are all addressing the climate emergency, and they're doing this more elegantly and collaboratively using Quarto. Quarto has giving us a mosaic of voices - Quarto let us bring these kinds of notebooks together.


Growing the mosaic. 
meeting people where they were
I reimagined how I worked with groups. I learned how to work with groups. 
**Transition of behavior is the power of Openscapes. **

I saw the power of it, saw what it could do: brought it together wit hthier 
Thread that Openscapes is an integral part of this work; Quarto is a tool that's enabled us. 

I don't want to say that quarto's going to save us but the way it's enabled us to come together and do big work is going to. It's lowering the barriers and blurring lines. 

Here are a few stories: a few ways that this is happening

:::

# Making the mosaic actionable 

Engage: Make the implicit explicit

Empower: Onboard learners as contributors 

Amplify: Reuse (and credit!) good ideas

One of the ways you welcome people is making the implicit explicit.
This is about writing down the rules and expectations so that that people are set up to succeed.

This helps people transition from being an outsider to part of the community

Gavin Fay's lab at UMass Dartmouth is one of the marine science teams was mentored through Openscapes they then went and wrote a public lab manual that puts their values forward along with these rules and expectations.
This was a way to builds trust, psych safety, and resilience with the team, and was particuarly important as they had new members join their lab remotely during the Pandemic.

Transition: This then enabled a second form of Welcome -

:::
:::

::: notes
And to welcome more people we need to reuse and extend good ideas. We loved how the FayLab made the implict explicit and brought that idea to NASA.

As we were first dev'ing the NASA Mentor community, there wasn't a place to make the implicit explicit. One of the mentors Catalina has said how Quarto has given her a place to share ideas earlier, comfortable sharing imperfect work and getting feedback.

And it's been cool to see how Quarto has enabled us to not only reuse things like tutorials but also ideas like how to design and facilitate learning events. One of the things here is that open science is a way to work. It's not just about products, it's about process. It's about people.

Transition: So these examples so far have been about openly creating documentation for your team, which is a big part of reimagining how we work. And it's also an opportunity to extend this in other resources as well.

To onboard learners as contributors.
This is a really important part of reimagining and welcoming: it's about breaking out these models that are hierarchical and enfantilizing.

People might be learners in some situation and deep experts in others and it's important that there is space and place for them to contribute early as they join a team.

It's been really exciting to see how Quarto has enabled collaboration across coding comfort levels.
The idea of who is a coder...

The way we've see the Fay Lab do this is that part of this documentation is how to contribute if see a typo or a broken link or a gap, so that's a way for them to upskill, contribute early.
This is also a way to invest in and mantain this community resource.

# Removing barriers, blurring lines {.julie background-image="images/2019ESWPoster316x24MTeditnoNP_cropped_sm_er.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"} 

**New ways of tackling challenges means new tech, new habits, new culture.**

Mosiac of voices: we need everyone

::: notes
Just want to emphasize the power of removing barriers and blurring lines.  of who's a coder or not

Blurred: End the mosiac: through this work for this last year, we've been able to remove barrier and I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. Looking forward to this collective community contributes to this mosiac



Lights at Night
Rivers - instead: patchwork of landuse. Landsat. Mosiac. 



This is just the beginning. There's so much more to write, so much more to do, we need the Earthrise quote. Do more than cop, grounded, steady, ready

when it comes to who is a coder and not and how we value contribution.

The more we talk about this and role model what's possible, the more actionable we all become.

And throughout all of this is the idea that we can collaborate across coding comfort levels.
It's been really neat to see how Quarto can not only reduce barriers across coding languages like python and R, but also differnt experience levels.

![](images/visual_editor.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"} This is a screenshot of the new Visual Editor that is part of the RStudio IDE, and it's something we've been experimenting with more and more.
We've found this to be a really nice way to write prose even for those familiar with Markdown, but it's also a friendlier way for people to get to know the tools.

This is about not assuming technical skills, but creating an safe culture where they can say what they don't know and reinforce a peer-learning & teaching culture, and using tooling that is friendly for new and seasoned coders alike.

Transition: Let me demo Quarto with the Visual editor - it's really exciting to blur those lines between who identifies as a coder or not using these tools collaboratively.

## Coda

-   RMarkdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages

So, earth, pale blue dot<br> We will fail you not.<br>

Just as we chose to go to the moon<br> We know it's never too soon<br> To choose hope.<br> We choose to do more than cope<br> With climate change<br> We choose to end it---<br> We refuse to lose.<br> Together we do this and more<br> Not because it's very easy or nice<br> But because it is necessary,<br> Because with every dawn we carry<br> the weight of the fate of this celestial body orbiting a star.<br> And as heavy as that weight sounded, it doesn't hold us down,<br> But it keeps us grounded, steady, ready,<br> Because an environmental movement of this size<br> Is simply another form of an earthrise.<br>
