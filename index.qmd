# Julie title slide speaker notes: Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have both been using Quarto for over a last year. As we've experimented with using it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're excited to talk with you today about how it improves the way we share, collaborate, teach, and reimagine. In short, we're excited to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

**Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem**
:::

::: notes
Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem. It builds on 10 years of insight from RMarkdown.

It unifies the RMarkdown ecosystem in a way that people who love RMarkdown will find little points of friction removed, little things that were different between for example bookdown and xaringan, now have a common approach. It's easier to share, it's easier to teach. And it extends the RMarkdown ecosystem in a way that people who do not yet know RMarkdown have a really friendly tool that interoperates with how they already work. And this really influences how we can all collaborate and reimagine together.

::: notes
Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year. I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke. The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching. Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles. Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation. More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well. So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## Next generation R Markdown

![](images/rmd-to-quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem. Beyond unification, Quarto also makes available attractive and handy features like tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc. consistently across the various outputs.

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website

:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving between formats within Quarto is straightforward

-   Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website)
-   It's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

**Better science for future us**:

-   for ourselves, teams, communities in the next hour, week, decades

::: notes
Openscapes is about better science for future us. I launched Openscapes based on my experiences as a researcher transitioning to better science, and with my partner Erin Robinson of Metadata GameChangers have built it into a sustainable and scalable program that we're really excited about.

There is a lot more to this but what's particularly relevant here is that the R community has played a huge role in shaping this.

We focus on Better science for future us, which we think of as

Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. Our main focus is to empower research teams. A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.

**NASA staff collaborate across Data Centers to support.**

::: notes
Traditionally, these data are stored by 12 different data centers and researchers download the data in order to analyze it locally.

The new paradigm is Researchers will move their compute to the Cloud, which requires much more programmatic access rather than map- and menu-based access.

It also means that NASA staff needs to collaborate across Data Centers to support researchers with best practices for open data science.

And that's where Openscapes comes in.

Our NASA-Openscapes project is to develop a cross-data center Mentor community to create and teach a common set of Earthdata tutorials that Mentors iterate for specific science examples.

Over the last year we've worked with just amazing engineers and user support staff to learn and co-create this together.

We've focused on finding the common needs across all Mentors, creating a teaching culture, and having them contribute to shared resources as part of their jobs. On that note thank managers and leadership from all different levels of NASA who have supported their staff in making this transition themselves.

We've done a lot in the last year. But in those early days, this was all very new and intimidating to me. While Erin has been a part of the NASA community for the last decade, I was unfamiliar with Earth science as a research domain, the types of data NASA works with, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly. Transition: And a fourth big thing that was challenging -
:::

# NASA Earth scientists use python 😬

::: notes
NASA Earth scientists largely use python. This was a new world to me that we needed to figure out how to navigate. Erin and my role was not to learn python from the ground up, we but we needed to be able to support teams of python users and advise them and interoperate with them. This was really intimidating to me.

TODO: add quarto penguins, remove background except stones

::: notes
We were able to do that with Quarto. I've been collaborating with J.J. Allaire about RMarkdown, and I knew that he was working on something called Quarto that was something about RMarkdown for Python. So as our NASA Openscapes project got going in Spring 2021 I asked J.J. if we could use Quarto. Both J.J. and the quarto dev team and the NASA mentors were willing to take this on together, and we became the first external-to-RStudio users of Quarto. It's been just an incredible collaboration: we've been able to use Quarto to interface between R and Python worlds and also contribute to some of the design of Quarto based on our needs and use.

# Teach

![](images/quadrants-teach.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

Reimagining science means making open science a daily practice, and thinking beyond open products like publications and thinking about open process like teaching and supporting each other.
It's about daily habits and workflows, and really interrogating who is included, in terms of tech and culture. We've been trying to understand the question of who is safe to participate and work against things that deepens inequality.

Open science as a daily practice is one of those things that once you see it, you can't un-see it. It's a different way of thinking and working and once you do you're interested in helping others too.

For us, for scaling, and to give visibilty and value to the work we're doing, which is a really powerful interface between coaching, mentoring, facilitating, project management, community engagement, and modern tech, data science, cloud computing and big data, for environmental change. - Quarto gave us that place; I'd made many books before but included code - Lowered the barrier. Installed RStudio, used the Visual Editor together. before she learned how to code, and may have given her that confidence she needed - has since learned R, Python, and Matlab - Dev'd mentors community - a way to onboard people and help them contribute. - This is an idea we learned from Gavin Fay's Lab Manual, which his team developed as Openscapes Champions. - Will be repeating this specifically for NMFS, a work in progress. moving from the Wiki, help give visibilty and value - As our documentation grew, Thinking about Modular lessons - our intro to Quarto websites tutorial is stand-alone, small. but linked from Approach Guide and from NASA Cookbook.

## Hi, I'm Julie

-   Long-time user of R Markdown, and also Quarto
-   Changed my work-life and my life-life
-   Theme: collaborating

::: notes
Julie: So excited to be here. I am a long-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults. This as you'll see has been helping me push and blur the boundaries of environmental science, open source, and teaching. What I'll share today is a huge team-effort with many colleagues, that also builds from many folks in the R and open science communities.

## Openscapes {background-image="images/horst_openscapes_champions.jpg" background-size="600px"}

::: notes
Julie: In the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. But a lot of us feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. Through the Champions program we will help you explore and navigate these pathways; you'll find common approaches with your team as you identify your trailhead and safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as you go. We mentor and developed and have iterated a whole flywheel for culture change

But when Erin Robinson joined Openscapes she brought expertise in scaling programs and making them sustainable. She introduced this idea of the Flywheel of the steps needed to really create lasting culture change.

It involves focusing beyond delivering the Champions program; and how there is a whole series of steps that interplay...

## Create space

Prioritize time.

Build trust, psychological safety, inclusion

Ask how people work, where they're stuck, what they know.

Foster a learning culture. And a teaching culture. Empathy. Growth Mindset. Meet people where they are.

::: illustration

::: notes
Learning. messy. Don't need to have a plan, just you want to do better. make the space. Takes time to learn and do, amazing what folks can do together. Across backgrounds, skills, expertise.

Managers at NASA, NOAA, faculty at universities. Supporting people's time to learn. open science must be part of people's paid work.

NOAA Cohort right now with 9 Supervisors participating.

Necessary part of reimagining: Time.
:::

::: notes
This might be dated now 1. Share your ideas earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture 2. Reuse: create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science. 3. bring inclusion into your daily work (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs

Where we put things, what contributing looks like

-   **Create space & place to explore & learn.** Cohort Calls, Seaside Chats, Co-Working; GitHub, R, Python, Quarto, Google Drive, Slack; Efficiency & Inclusion Tips.

-   **Cultivate relationships & real connections.** Welcoming folks w/ diverse backgrounds; meeting where they are; skills to empower immediate work; kinder science.
