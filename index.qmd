## Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem {.julie}

A new open-source scientific and technical publishing system.
The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.

::: notes
Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year.
I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke.
The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching.
Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles.
Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation.
More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well.
So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.
:::

## Next generation R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration:** Many "down" hex logos on one side, Quarto logo and some indication of other languages on the other side.
:::

-   5 or 6 things that were in diff formats

-   Side-by-side with quarto vs Rmd

    -   Enumerage: tabsets, code-folding, highlighting.¬†

::: notes
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages.
It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors
:::

## Knit vs render?

-   Rmd -\> knitr -\> pandoc: R package (rmarkdown) doing the orchestration
-   Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc: Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is easy\* {.small}

*\*but don't call things "easy", need a better adjective...*

Teaching: creating materials and teaching the tools

-   Moving between formats within Quarto is easy: Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website) and it's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)
-   Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is easy
    -   Is teaching Quarto different from teaching R Markdown? Easier / harder / **not different**?
    -   Potential anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve...

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books).
Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code.
This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

I'm a marine ecologist \> data scientist \> open science champion

rstats changed my life - Better science, Kinder science refs

Long-time RMarkdown user - I launched Openscapes with RMarkdown (blogdown website, bookdown curriculum, distill blog events page).
Out of the box!

::: notes
Julie: I'm a marine ecologist \> data scientist \> open science champion A lot of this change is because the R community changed my life; my research team learned the hard way that we couldn't reproduce our own work with our default approaches to data analysis and collaboration.
RMarkdown and the tidyverse played an underpinning role in our transition to better science And this all led me to shifting my career to helping other research teams transition too transition: I launched Openscapes with the goal to help other research teams, and in partnership with Erin Robinson who brought the plan for scaling and sustainability, we've radically iterated and turned it into what it is today

## Openscapes

We mentor research teams to transition to inclusive open data science workflows

We've worked with 70+ teams

# Openscapes \<\> Quarto story begins with NASA

üöÄüåè

<br> [NASA-Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io): helping researchers using NASA Earthdata transition analytical workflows to the Cloud

::: notes
Julie: The Openscapes Quarto story begins with NASA.
This was our first project with Erin and me, Erin comes from the NASA community, connected Openscapes approach with needs she knew at NASA Remotely-sensed satellite imagery used to track pollution, agriculture, etc.
Very different data and challenges Earth science community is heavily Python oriented And you'll notice that I'm an R user not Python, and I'm not Earth Science I won't lie, I was super intimidated, feeling like I was out of my league.
Like a fish out of water, and specifically, in outerspace.

The nicest people - zoom picture?
But a lot of new-ness, scary.
:::

## But I had a secret

I'd seen what was possible with RMarkdown

Experience and confidence built up over years

## Quarto let me bring my secret to Python/NASA

Collaborating with J.J.
and the Quarto dev team

NASA Mentors saw it and were willing to go for it

## Earthdata Cloud Cookbook

creating collections

orientation

::: notes
Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made, started in spring 2021.
It's beautiful.
It's a collection of how to guides and tutorials - we could organize what we had and make placeholders for where we saw gaps as we developed them together.
It helped us all come together as a team, from across silos, with different skills, comfort with coding, different coding language, different tech.
Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

# Teach

![](images/quadrants-teach.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices.
Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output.
(Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)
:::

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row.
Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.

-   Teaching: Course website with obvious folders
-   Writing: Book - R4DS
-   Research: Journal articles
:::

::: notes
Mine: And last 10% to tweak it for your context...
:::

## DEMO: File architecture, books

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `# Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

# Reimagine

![](images/quadrants-reimagine.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Julie: What Mine just showed was really powerful for me - once I saw what I could do for my current needs, I saw new ways to reuse and reimagine future ideas.
I built Openscapes because of what what I saw was possible with RMarkdown, and it has only increased and extended because of Quarto.
Let me tell you about Openscapes, and what our work looks like day to day
:::

## Reimagining science

beyond publications, beyond code & data: websites, blogs, shiny apps...

beyond silos, domains, borders, languages: sharing, collaboration...

open web...

culture change

actionable change (pandemic)

::: notes
Julie:
:::

## Open science as a movement

-   (It's about products (access to data, code, publications))

-   It's about process.
    Workflows.
    People.
    Daily habits.
    Culture.
    Open source tooling.

It's the way science should be done, but who can participate?
Both from a tech and culture perspective

Hugely inspired by Climate Justice, Get Out the Vote movements

Urgency: Why this matters.
Collaborate with people sooner, co-create/reuse not reinvent.
Connect the skills to the values with the urgency.

::: notes
if you are already into open science, open source tools like Quarto helps you execute open science.
And if you're not already into open science, open source tools like Quarto can be an entryway and motivator to get engaged

There's more emphasis on open science and this is the way science should be done.
All these things about open up your process \> one of the challenges have been tools that allow you to easily do these things the things.
These allow you to do thie
:::

## We've been learning a lot through helping teams reimagine

Tackling challenges in new ways means new tech, new habits, new culture.

Important for new & seasoned coders, and folks who don't identify as coders.

Reducing friction so folks focus their time on their work/science: less reinventing

**Quarto really helps underscore these points**

## Create space

Prioritize time.

Build trust, psychological safety, inclusion

Ask how people work, where they're stuck, what they know.

Foster a learning culture.
And a teaching culture.
Empathy.
Growth Mindset.
Meet people where they are.

::: illustration
**Image:** Seaside Chats, Surf sessions
:::

::: notes
Learning.
messy.
Don't need to have a plan, just you want to do better.
make the space.
Takes time to learn and do, amazing what folks can do together.
Across backgrounds, skills, expertise.

Managers at NASA, NOAA, faculty at universities.
Supporting people's time to learn.
open science must be part of people's paid work.

NOAA Cohort right now with 9 Supervisors participating.

Necessary part of reimagining: Time.
:::

::: notes
This might be dated now 1.
Share your ideas earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture 2.
Reuse: create-once-use-often.
less reinventing; focus your time on the science.
3.
bring inclusion into your daily work (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs
:::

## Create place

Quarto has been really key for us with NASA Openscapes (also JupyterHub, GitHub, Google Docs)

Where we put things, what contributing looks like

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of quarto 2021 Cloud Hackathon site

Create a learning culture. We've borrowed this idea for Approach Guide Book websites to collaborate on? Not really how we thought about things before
:::

## DEMO: Visual editor

Leverage tooling that reduces barriers

::: demo
-   open project in RStudio
-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates.
-   Also nice for markdown-savvy writers
-   Show tips: "I learned this from Mine while we were preparing our slides"
-   Images, Tables
-   Call-outs
-   Citations: DOIs
:::

::: notes
Julie:

-   Mara: Quarto has more "guardrails" for users - more friendly for sometone who hasn't worked in this environment before \> maybe up in the visual editor part/
:::

## Reimagining together

All We Can Save:

> " 'We' speaks to the collective, to collaboration, to community, to the relational work at hand. Addressing the climate crisis...will take everyone.

> 'We' speaks to justice, to how we do the work that needs doing and whose contributions are valued.
> We cannot, we must not, go it alone" - Ayana Elizabeth Johnson & Katharine Wilkinson,
