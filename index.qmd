## Hi, I'm Julie

*Unpolished ideas:*

-   I'm a marine ecologist and founded Openscapes to help research teams collaborate around data and open science workflows.
-   I am a prolific RMarkdown and Quarto user, but not a pro user
-   Theme: collaborating

## What is Quarto

Next generation R Markdown: Quarto is something you can use if you love Rmd.

-   it combines/unifies some "down" packages (visual) - abundnace of hex logos
-   but not just that: plus: it also brings in Jupyter and other languages (python, Julia). provdies that functionality even ir you're not coming from R ecosystem

## Demo - flexibility in the formats

-   Change extension from .rmd to .qmd and render

-   Change format from doc to reveal.js (no slide breaks) (then change back to html)

-   Show `_quarto.yml` and make a \~2-page site

**Story:** teaching winter course - diff formats within R (web, slides, course web) I go between the formats a lot (Rmd 8 ways)

## Graphic: what is "knit vs render"?

(this comes after changing the extension from .rmd to .qmd)

-   simply arrow/point on that spot where it's different, and convey this difference

## What is Quarto

Quarto is something you can use even if you've never used Rmd.

## Lowndes et al. 2017

-   open data science (R/RStudio/RMarkdown)

::: notes
Julie: Foundations from Openscapes comes from my own work and experience, and R
:::

## Demo - flexibility in the tooling

-   Render Mine's example site in VS Code (from GH?), then JupyterLab

-   Include `.ipynb` in example site

-   Return to RStudio, I can do this from my comfort place too.

**Story:** working with NASA Openscapes team create space and place: Collaboration across R & Python, across coders and non-coders

## Quarto enables new ways of sharing

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing

-   If it's not easy to make a course website, you won't
-   Tooling that makes it easy to share with the world
-   New way of getting credit
-   Open sharing of knowledge. Other people can just take
-   When it comes time for promotion/review, I say here it is
-   Last 10% to tweak it for your context

**Story:**

## Quarto enables reuse & reimagining

-   create-once-use-often
-   less reinventing; focus your time on the science
-   

**Story:**

-   also Openscapes
