# Intro

## Hi, I'm Julie

-   Long-time user of R Markdown, and also Quarto
-   Changed my work-life and my life-life
-   Theme: collaborating

::: aside
Julie: So excited to be here. I am a long-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults. This as you'll see has been helping me push and blur the boundaries of environmental science, open source, and teaching. What I'll share today is a huge team-effort with many colleagues, that also builds from many folks in the R and open science communities.
:::

## Hi, I'm Mine

-   Also a long-time user of R Markdown and of Quarto

-   [TO DO: Add one more bullet point]{.todo}

-   Theme: authoring and education

::: aside
Mine: I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on. I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

# Quarto is for people who love R Markdown

:::

## Next generation R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration:** Many "down" hex logos on one side, Quarto logo and some indication of other languages on the other side.
:::

::: aside
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

[TO DO: Replace contents of this slide with screen recording.]{.todo}

::: demo
-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a \_quarto.yml, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
:::

::: aside
Mine: [TO DO: Create screen recording and write script.]{.todo}

## Knit vs render?

::: illustration
**Illustration:** A graphic and a arrow pointing at a high-level where it's different.

Rmd -\> knitr -\> pandoc -- R package (rmarkdown) doing the orchestration

Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc -- Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: aside
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Story: Flexibility of moving between formats makes time for other things... {.smaller}

-   teaching background
-   teaching winter course - anecdote from art history student?
-   Why is this interesting, is it diff from teaching Rmd? easier, harder? Not different?
-   diff formats within R (web, slides, course web) I go between the formats a lot (Rmd 8 ways)

::: aside
Mine: As an educator, two things are of upmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

## NASA Openscapes

Supporting NASA Earth science research teams' migration to the cloud

-   collaboration across silos (culture of reuse)
-   upskilling the workforce (tech & teaching)
:::
:::

::: aside
Julie: I'm excited to share this story of our NASA Openscapes project, where we are helping NASA support research teams migrating to analysis in the cloud as they migrate their earthdata satellite imagery to the cloud. Co-lead: Erin Robinson
:::

## Quarto helps streamline teamwork

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of quarto Earthdata Cloud Cookbook.
:::

::: aside
Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made, started in spring 2021. It's beautiful.

Streamlines teamwork: we came together from across silos, with different skills, comfort with coding, different coding language, different tech. Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

I want to talk about streamlining teamwork in 2 ways: interoperating with tech, and interoperating with people.
:::

## Interoperability with tech (1/2)

creating collections

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of portion of `_quarto.yml`: .ipynbs, .rmds, .qmds
:::

::: aside
Julie: language compatibility - using quarto with a python-heavy crowd I'm able to build from what I've learned with R and share with the python crowd (flexibility in the tooling) *Julie TODO: add HLS .Rmd*
:::

## Interoperability with tech (2/2)

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot .qmd with python and R code
:::

::: aside
Julie: language compatibility - using quarto to support researchers early - first dev is in python but not limited
:::

## Interoperability with people

aka collaboration

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of Zoom.
:::

::: aside
Julie: collaboration with J.J. & the quarto team \<\> NASA Openscapes.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the tooling

[TO DO: Replace with screen recording.]{.todo}

::: demo
-   Render Mine's example site in JupyterHub, quarto preview
-   Add `.ipynb`, workflow (code: palmerpenguins in python?)
-   `quarto convert` to .qmd
-   Open in VS Code, show `.qmd` (cmd-shift-k to render \[attention to other tool chains available\])
-   Mention: You install Quarto with a CLI, (like git) so you can work with whatever tooling you want

# Quarto enables new ways of sharing + organization

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

-   Teaching: Consistent and transparent/obvious org across course websites and materials
-   Writing: Book - R4DS
-   Research: Journal articles

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row. Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.
:::

::: aside
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what I do day to day, but what that looks like in practice... you might know my responsibilities but you might not know my practices... maybe add PPT anecdote here... Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output.
:::

## some title... {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing

-   If it's not easy to make a course website, you won't
-   Tooling that makes it easy to share with the world on the web
-   Open sharing of knowledge. Other people can just take and benefit from and it's a new way of getting credit
-   When it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created"
-   Last 10% to tweak it for your context

::: aside
Mine: Might merge with previous slide for a longer story
:::

## DEMO: File architecture, books {.smaller}

[TO DO: Replace contents of this slide with screen recording.]{.todo}

::: demo
-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `#Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

:::

::: notes
Julie: What Mine just showed was really powerful for me - once I saw what I could do for my current needs, I saw new ways to reuse  and reimagine future ideas. 
:::

## What we do at Openscapes

We help teams collaborate, upskill, become resilient. 

![](images/horst_pew_tools_practice_mindset.jpg){fig-align="center" width="40%"}


::: aside
Julie: I started off saying that I'm leading Openscapes, but you likely have no idea what that is or actually looks like day to day...
We create a learning culture, break down silos and loneliness
creating space - people; creating place - tech 
**Better science for future us**

:::

## Open science as a movement

*placeholder slide* - why this matters. Collaborate with people sooner.

## Reimagining - First websites

::: illustration
**Image:** Openscapes website (blogdown), Lesson Series 
:::

::: aside
As we were getting started, knew we could share as we built out the idea
:::

## 3 big things

1. Share your ideas earlier - A way to welcome folks to join you
2. Reuse: create-once-use-often
3. Build inclusion into your daily work - documentation, onboarding

**This is exciting for coders. Also important for folks who don't code or don't identify as coders.** 

::: aside
Julie: Co-create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus time on the science.

seeing this enabled with NASA and quarto - but also NOAA Fisheries: https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/index.html
:::

## Reimagining - Onboarding

::: illustration
**Image:** Fay Lab Manual
:::

[Gavin Fay lab manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)


::: aside
Julie: This is another way this manifests: Onboarding (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs. little things. Create a learning culture. We've borrowed this idea for Approach Guide
Book websites to collaborate on? Not really how we thought about things before
:::

## Reuse - Approach Guide

[Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/) (inspired by Gavin)




## DEMO: Visual editor

[TO DO: Replace with screen recording.]{.todo}

::: demo
-   open project in RStudio
-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates
:::

::: aside
Julie: Culture of trust, less reinventing. Meets someone like me where they are and supports them. (Revisit from useR) Not necessarily for existing/experienced users to change their ways but to create an opportunity for including others...
:::


## Openscapes: reimagining with Quarto {.smaller}

1.  share earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture
2.  bring inclusion into your daily practice (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs
3.  Reuse: create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science.

::: aside
Julie: summary slide and transition

Reprise from NASA Openscapes - find the common - reuse existing - contribute to fill gaps - foster a learning culture

## Coda

-   RMarkdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages

# Quarto examples and resources

## some title... {.smaller}

-   Mine's Toronto talk
-   Julie's Quarto tutorial (building from 2016 Rmd tutorial)
-   Sample sites, books, etc.

## (Champions landscape)

![](images/horst_openscapes_champions.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

::: notes
Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. Our main focus is to empower research teams. A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.
