## Hi, I'm Julie

-   Long-time user of R Markdown, and also Quarto
-   Changed my work-life and my life-life
-   Theme: collaborating

::: aside
Julie: So excited to be here. I am a long-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults. This as you'll see has been helping me push and blur the boundaries of environmental science, open source, and teaching. What I'll share today is a huge team-effort with many colleagues, that also builds from many folks in the R and open science communities.
:::

## Hi, I'm Mine

-   Also a long-time user of R Markdown and of Quarto

-   [TO DO: Add one more bullet point]{.todo}

-   Theme: authoring and education

::: aside
Mine: I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on. I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.
:::

## Why Quarto? (1/2)

### Unifies & extends RMarkdown ecosystem

-   Unifies: Rethink the things that evolved organically across RMarkdown for 10 years. "Mosaic" idea. Things that have been "unified" in quarto

-   Extends: doesn't have a dependency or requirement for R; developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia, with the idea that it will work even for languages that don't yet exist.

-   Extends: Has more "guardrails" for users - accessibility and inclusion centered in the design (Mara)

::: notes
Quarto combines the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system with "batteries included" that reflects everything we've learned from R Markdown over the past 10 years. In addition, many new features are available including extensions for cross-references, figure panels, callouts, advanced page layout, and more. While it is a "new" system, it should also be noted that it is highly compatible with existing content: you can render most R Markdown documents and Jupyter notebooks unmodified with Quarto. J.J. will discuss the philosophy and design of the system, demonstrate its capabilities, and talk about future directions for development.
:::

## Why Quarto? (2/2)

A new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.

Inputs in multiple languages

Outputs in multiple formats

All going through the same machinery

# Quarto is for people who love R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Quarto logo with one quadrant showing the words "Quarto is for people who love R Markdown" and the others grayed out.
:::

## Next generation R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration:** Many "down" hex logos on one side, Quarto logo and some indication of other languages on the other side.
:::

-   5 or 6 things that were in diff formats

-   Side-by-side with quarto vs Rmd

    -   Enumerage: tabsets, code-folding, highlighting. 

::: aside
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a \_quarto.yml, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors
:::

::: aside
Mine: ...

## Knit vs render?

::: illustration
**Illustration:** A graphic and a arrow pointing at where they're different, at a high level.

-   Rmd -\> knitr -\> pandoc: R package (rmarkdown) doing the orchestration
-   Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc: Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: aside
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is easy\* {.small}

*\*but don't call things "easy", need a better adjective...*

Teaching: creating materials and teaching the tools

-   Moving between formats within Quarto is easy: Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website) and it's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)
-   Moving from R Markdown to Quarto is easy
    -   Is teaching Quarto different from teaching R Markdown? Easier / harder / **not different**?
    -   Potential anecdote: Art history student writing thesis in Quarto. One semester to thesis writing a much less steep learning curve...

::: aside
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

## Quarto helps streamline teamwork

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of quarto Earthdata Cloud Cookbook.
:::

::: aside
Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made, started in spring 2021. It's beautiful. Automatic beautiful TOC on the right side

Streamlines teamwork: we came together from across silos, with different skills, comfort with coding, different coding language, different tech. Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

I want to talk about streamlining teamwork in 2 ways: interoperating with tech, and interoperating with people.
:::

## Interoperability with tech (1/2)

creating collections

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of portion of `_quarto.yml`: .ipynbs, .rmds, .qmds
:::

::: aside
Julie: language compatibility - using quarto with a python-heavy crowd I'm able to build from what I've learned with R and share with the python crowd (flexibility in the tooling) *Julie TODO: add HLS .Rmd*
:::

## Interoperability with tech (2/2)

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot .qmd with python and R code
:::

::: aside
Julie: language compatibility - using quarto to support researchers early - first dev is in python but not limited

## Interoperability with people

aka collaboration

## Quotes/etc

## DEMO: Flexibility in the tooling

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Render Mine's example site in JupyterHub, quarto preview
-   Add `.ipynb`, workflow (code: palmerpenguins in python?)
-   `quarto convert` to .qmd
-   Open in VS Code, show `.qmd` (cmd-shift-k to render \[attention to other tool chains available\])
-   Mention: You install Quarto with a CLI, (like git) so you can work with whatever tooling you want

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: aside
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)
:::

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row. Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.

-   Teaching: Course website with obvious folders
-   Writing: Book - R4DS
-   Research: Journal articles
:::

::: aside
Mine: And last 10% to tweak it for your context...
:::

## DEMO: File architecture, books

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Change `_bookdown.yml` to `_quarto.yml` - maybe...
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `# Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

:::

::: notes
Julie: What Mine just showed was really powerful for me - once I saw what I could do for my current needs, I saw new ways to reuse and reimagine future ideas. I built Openscapes because of what what I saw was possible with RMarkdown, and it has only increased and extended because of Quarto. Let me tell you about Openscapes, and what our work looks like day to day
:::

## Openscapes helps teams transition to inclusive open science workflows

::: {#openscapes-toc layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/horst_pew_tools_practice_mindset.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

[We mentor teams to better tackle their questions by modernizing shared practices, underpinned by existing tools.\
We work with NASA, NOAA, government, non-profit, and academic groups in environmental and Earth science]{.smaller}
:::

::: notes
Julie: We mentor teams We create a learning culture, break down silos and loneliness creating space - people; creating place - tech **Better science for future us**

For reimagining habits and culture change

Openscapes helps research teams Collab around data. Tech diffs, experience. Inclusion, behavior change.

Called open science (like nmfs intro)
:::

## Open science is a movement

-   (It's about products (access to data, code, publications))

-   It's about process. Workflows. People. Daily habits. Culture. Open source tooling.

-   [Open software means kinder science](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/) (Lowndes 2019, Scientific American)

It's the way science should be done, but who can participate? Both from a tech and culture perspective

Hugely inspired by Climate Justice, Get Out the Vote movements, rOpenSci, RStudio, RLadies, Mozilla

Urgency. why this matters. Collaborate with people sooner, co-create/reuse not reinvent. Connect the skills to the values with the urgency.

::: notes
if you are already into open science, open source tools like Quarto helps you execute open science. And if you're not already into open science, open source tools like Quarto can be an entryway and motivator to get engaged

There's more emphasis on open science and this is the way science should be done. All these things about open up your process \> one of the challenges have been tools that allow you to easily do these things the things. These allow you to do thie

# Stories for reuse and reimagining / how Openscapes enables open science

::: aside
Julie: Friday ideas (email to myself)

Creates place (w jupyerhib and GitHub)

Write things down - Gavin and approach and earth data cookbook

And share ideas early like Openscapes original. Teaching culture.
:::

## Create place

Quarto, (w jupyerhib and GitHub) \> Multi-lingual:: big part of NASA story. Tool that makes it easier for diff languages. you might be a beginner or advanced. You can write a pretty beautiful lab manual/book. Bringing togeter to one place.

Create-once-use-often

Reuse

Create place & shared workflows

Reimagining - books

::: notes
Julie: Co-create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus time on the science.

seeing this enabled with NASA and quarto - but also NOAA Fisheries: https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/index.html

Catalina quote: "I still get kudos"

## Make the implicit explicit

Reimagine culture. Write things down

Write things down - Gavin and approach and earth data cookbook

**Build inclusion into your daily work** - onboarding

Prev examples are really exciting for coders. Also important for folks who don't code or don't identify as coders.

Make the implicit explicit - writing things down

Julie: This is another way this manifests: Onboarding (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs. little things. Create a learning culture. We've borrowed this idea for Approach Guide Book websites to collaborate on? Not really how we thought about things before
:::

## Share ideas earlier

Share your vision; a way to welcome folks to join you

And share ideas early like Openscapes original. Teaching culture.

websites & blogs

not limited to a final publication (comfortable with imperfect)

::: illustration
**Image:** Openscapes website (blogdown), Lesson Series?
:::

::: aside
As we were getting started, knew we could share as we built out the idea
:::

## Necessary part of all this: Create space. Time.

Takes time to learn and do, open science must be part of people's paid work. Amazing what folks can do together. Across backgrounds, skills expertise.

Learning culture. Inclusion important. trust. etc. Tooling and culture

Examples: Slides from Amy Steiker and Josh London. Learning. messy.

## Reimagine - All together now

::: illustration
image: [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/), revisit NASA Openscapes
:::

1.  Share your ideas earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture
2.  Reuse: create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science.
3.  bring inclusion into your daily work (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs

## Leadup to demo

I've already talked about the language aspect, let me show you the tooling aspect with the visual editor

## DEMO: Visual editor

::: demo
-   open project in RStudio
-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates.
-   Show tips: "I learned this from Mine while we were preparing our slides"
-   Images, Tables
-   Call-outs
-   DOIs
:::

::: aside
Julie: Culture of trust, less reinventing. Meets someone like me where they are and supports them. (Revisit from useR) Not necessarily for existing/experienced users to change their ways but to create an opportunity for including others...

-   Mara: Quarto has more "guardrails" for users - more friendly for sometone who hasn't worked in this environment before \> maybe up in the visual editor part/

::: aside
Visual Editor: Mine's "this functionality exists" vs Julie's "this is designed to be inviting"

You've already seen bits and pieces of the visual editor. it's not just a bag of tricks, it's an inviting environment/ more than the sum of its parts

![](images/horst_openscapes_champions.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

::: notes
Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. Our main focus is to empower research teams. A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.
