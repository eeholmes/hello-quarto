# Intro

## Hi, I'm Julie

-   Long-time user of R Markdown, and also Quarto
-   Changed my work-life and my life-life
-   Theme: collaborating

::: aside
Julie: So excited to be here.
I am a log-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults.
This as you'll see has been helping me push and blur the boundaries of environmental science, open source, and teaching.
:::

## Hi, I'm Mine

-   Also a long-time user of R Markdown and of Quarto

-   [TO DO: Add one more bullet point]{.todo}

-   Theme: authoring and education

::: aside
Mine: I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.
I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.
As an educator, two things are of upmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books).
Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code.
This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

:::

::: aside
Mine: Will talk about left side.
Julie: Will talk about right side.
Both: share demos, stories, FAQ's.
[Question for Julie: "Burning questions" instead of FAQs? Something else?]{.question}
:::

# Quarto is for people who love R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Quarto logo with one quadrant showing the words "Quarto is for people who love R Markdown" and the others grayed out.
:::

## Next generation R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration:** Many "down" hex logos on one side, Quarto logo and some indication of other languages on the other side.
:::

::: aside
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages.
It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

[TO DO: Replace contents of this slide with screen recording.]{.todo}

::: demo
-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a \_quarto.yml, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
:::

::: aside
Mine: [TO DO: Create screen recording and write script.]{.todo}
:::

## FAQ: knit vs render?

::: illustration
**Illustration:** A graphic and a arrow pointing at a high-level where it's different.

Rmd -\> knitr -\> pandoc -- R package (rmarkdown) doing the orchestration Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc -- Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: aside
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## FAQ: from Jenny or Jo?

[TO DO: Mine to pick one more question? If it looks like time might allow...]{.todo}

## Story 1: ...

[Question for Julie: I think the second story is less comparative so seems better but also might feel redundant to demo?]{.question}

-   teaching background
-   teaching winter course - anecdote from art history student?
-   Why is this interesting, is it diff from teaching Rmd? easier, harder? Not different?

OR: diff formats within R (web, slides, course web) I go between the formats a lot (Rmd 8 ways)

# Quarto is for people who have never used R Markdown

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Quarto logo with one quadrant showing the words "Quarto is for people who don't know R Markdown" and the others grayed out.
:::

## Quarto is something you can use even if you've never used RMarkdown

*unpolished ideas:*

-   nicely-formatted code & text together to publish
-   organizing your work as collections: documentation, code, notebooks
-   collaborating framework (across R & Python, across coders and non-coders)

::: aside
Julie: will start off with a story, then demo
:::

## NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of quarto book.
:::

::: aside
Julie: this is the first Quarto site I made.
3 cool things about this.
:::

## 1. Code & text together beautifully

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of quarto book, contributing page.
:::

::: aside
Julie: 1.
it looks familiar coming from RMarkdown.
It's beautiful...

-   first real content in it: taught others how to install quarto and contribute, knew it would change but that's ok, the beauty of quarto, it's dynamic, you don't feel stuck or static
:::

## 2. Interoperability with tech

creating collections

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshot of portion of `_quarto.yml`: .ipynbs not .Rmds.
:::

::: aside
Julie: 2.
language compatibility - using quarto with a python-heavy crowd I'm able to build from what I've learned with R and share with the python crowd (flexibility in the tooling)
:::

## 2b. Interoperability with tech

Image: screenshot .qmd with python and R code

::: aside
Julie: 2. language compatibility - using quarto to support researchers early - first dev is in python but not limited
:::

## 3. Interoperability with people

aka collaboration

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of Zoom.
:::

::: aside
3.  cool collaboration with J.J. and the quarto team AND NASA Openscapes.
:::

## NASA Openscapes Framework

Supporting NASA Earth science research teams\' migration to the cloud

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   find the common
-   reuse existing
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   contribute to fill gaps
-   foster a learning culture
:::
:::

::: aside
Julie: This book is part of a 3-year project with NASA to support scientific researcher teams using NASA Earthdata as they migrate their workflows to the cloud.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the tooling

[TO DO: Replace contents of this slide with screen recording.]{.todo}

::: demo
-   Render Mine's example site in JupyterHub, quarto preview
-   Add `.ipynb`, workflow
-   Also: show `earthdata` python code chunk and how it passes to R code chunk \> this has been huge for researchers in the cloud
-   Also open in VS Code, show `.qmd` (cmd-shift-k to render \[attention to other tool chains available\])
-   You install Quarto with a CLI, (like git) so you can work with whatever tooling you want
:::

::: aside
Julie:
:::

## NASA Openscapes and Quarto  

1.  code and text together beautifully
2.  interoperability with tech
3.  interoperability with people


## FAQ: Quarto is a workflow "philosophy" (and a document type)

::: aside
Julie: summary following demo to transition to Mine
:::

# Quarto enables new ways of sharing & organization

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Quarto logo with one quadrant showing the words "Quarto enables new ways of sharing & organization" and the others grayed out.
:::

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals

-   Teaching: Consistent and transparent/obvious org across course websites and materials
-   Writing: Book - R4DS
-   Research: Journal articles

::: illustration
**Image:** Screenshots of each next to each other on top row, folder organization of each on the bottom row.
Top looks different, bottom looks very similar.
:::

::: aside
Mine: Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output.
:::

## some title...

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing

-   If it's not easy to make a course website, you won't
-   Tooling that makes it easy to share with the world on the web
-   Open sharing of knowledge. Other people can just take and benefit from and it's a new way of getting credit
-   When it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created"
-   Last 10% to tweak it for your context

::: aside
Mine:
:::

## DEMO

[TO DO: Replace contents of this slide with screen recording.]{.todo}

[Question for Julie: Nothing to hand off, right?]{.question}

::: demo
-   visual editor
-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto"
-   Now to be a bit more principled about the transition (Change extension .rmd to .qmd and render to see it's fine)
-   Change \_bookdown.yml to \_quarto.yml
-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `#Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. Change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer.

## Story 2: ...

[Question for Julie -- Maybe the story is the "some title..." slide?]{.question}

# Quarto enables new ways of reuse & reimagining

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Quarto logo with one quadrant showing the words "Quarto enables new ways of reuse & reimagining" and the others grayed out.
:::

## Use quarto to be creative about emerging needs/new goals

(image)

::: aside
Julie: enabling sharing and organization across tooling and people (like Mine just showed) means it's easier to reuse and reimagine.

(creating new problems/solutions because quarto existion)- new ways of thinking that aren\'t standard practices. Book websites to collaborate on? Not really how we thought about things before

this really shows up with Openscapes
:::

## What we do at Openscapes

**Engage mentors • Empower research teams • Scale open practices**

-   people infrastructure - creating space.

-   tech infrastructure - creating place.

Create a learning culture, strengthen the open movement

::: aside
Julie: we help teams collaborate, upskill, become resilient. 3 big things:
:::

## 1. Share earlier

Image: Series book [Openscapes Lesson Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/)

A way to welcome folks to join you

::: aside
Julie: share earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd)

Was true
:::

## 2. Build inclusion into your daily work

image: Fay Lab Manual

-   [Gavin Fay lab manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)

::: aside
Julie: Onboarding (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs. little things.

::: aside
Create a learning culture
:::
:::

## 3. Reuse: co-create-once-use-often

*placeholder image - NMFS-Openscapes?*

-   [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/) (inspired by Gavin)

![](images/mentors-screenshot.png){fig-align="center" width="20%"}

::: aside
Julie: Co-create. create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science.

seeing this enabled with NASA and quarto - but also NOAA Fisheries: https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/index.html
:::

## Fostering a culture of reuse

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Interoperability (language, tooling, people) --\>
-   Enabling collaborations, transferrable skills
-   Can collaborate with people sooner.
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling \> culture change bc repro and sharing
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/horst_pew_tools_practice_mindset.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}
:::

::: aside
Julie: Openscapes helps teams develop practices that are underpinned by tools.
Quarto creates "place"
:::

## Demo / Showcase culture of reuse:

[TO DO: Replace contents of this slide with screen recording? Or just images?]{.todo}

::: demo
-   open one in RStudio
-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates
:::

-   

::: aside
Julie: Culture of trust, less reinventing.
Meets someone like me where they are and supports them.
(Revisit from useR)
:::

## Open science as a movement

*placeholder slide* - why this matters.
Collaborate with people sooner.

## Openscapes: reimagining with Quarto

1.  share earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture
2.  bring inclusion into your daily practice (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs
3.  Reuse: create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science.

# So much more to say...

## "12 more things we didn't get to showcase" {.smaller}

::: illustration
**Illustration / animation:** Penguin juggling, excitement.
:::

::: small
1.  "Diagram feature" maybe code \| output

2.  Works with Shiny - that's all to say

3.  Quarto pub?
    What it accomplishes \| what it looks like

4.  Yaml completion in chunk options

5.  Informative yaml errors

6.  Freeze \> blog posts, jupyter notebooks

7.  Each book chapter starting in a fresh session opening as you'd expect them to

8.  Table \> 2 tables next to each other

9.  Chalkboard on slides

10. Blog posts not running earlier posts

11. multiplex: Slides / scroll for audience

12. [TO DO: Add one more]{.todo}
:::

## Coda

-   RMarkdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages

# Quarto examples and resources

## some title...

-   Mine's Toronto talk
-   Julie's Quarto tutorial (building from 2016 Rmd tutorial)

# Cutting room floor

## 

The following slides won't be in the final talk

## (Champions landscape)

![](images/horst_openscapes_champions.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

::: notes
Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together.
Our main focus is to empower research teams.
A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view.
We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.
