Thank you so much, We're excited to be here!
Mine and I have both been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching with it since its earliest days and my Openscapes team is the first external users of Quarto.
As Mine and I have experimented with it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

::: notes
**Mine:**

Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year.
I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke.
The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching.
Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles.
Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation.
More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well.
So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.
:::

## R Markdown ecosystem {transition="zoom"}

![](images/rmd_ecosystem.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
**Mine:**

Julie mentioned unifying the R Markdown ecosystem so let's dig a bit more into what that means... Think of all the packages from the R Markdown universe that many of you've come to love and rely on over the years.
Each package addresses a different need and offers a different output: for example, you can use blogdown or distill for creating websites and blogs, bookdown for writing a book, rticles for writing journal articles, etc.
:::

## Next generation R Markdown {transition="zoom"}

![](images/horst_quarto_ball.png){width="900px" fig-align="center"}

::: notes
**Mine:**

Quarto unifies the functionality from a wide range of packages from the R Markdown ecosystem, building on Pandoc on the technical side and years of experience developing, maintaining, and tweaking these packages as well as community feedback on the human side.

**Illustration:** Add Allison's illustration of Request diagram at https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/hello-quarto-sdssg/#/running-code
:::

::: notes
**Mine:**

A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?" The main difference is that with R Markdown, the R package rmarkdown does the heavy lifting of the orchestration of going from source code (the Rmd file) to output, using knitr for evaluating the code chunks.
With Quarto, the Quarto command line interface (or CLI, for short) does the orchestration of processing executable code chunks with either knitr or jupyter and then converting the resulting markdown file to the desired output.
While this is technically impressive, I'll be honest, it's not necessarily what sparked my interest in Quarto in the first place.

::: notes
**Mine:** What did spark my interest was how easy, or, let's not say easy, I don't like that word in reference to any new technology, but how straightforward it is with Quarto to move between "things".
As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books).
Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code.
This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

Just over a bush is another group of animals: a fox with a welcome sign stands with a hedgehog holding map brochures In front of a larger park map. The fox and hedgehog are in front of a group of animals: a heron, a squirrel, a mouse holding a notebook, a raccoon, a snake, and a quail. In the midground, there’s a turtle, deer, owl and beaver by the river that has stepping stone rocks across. A roadrunner, lizard, blue bird, and rabbit, are walking down a path together, one of the other paths is blocked by a log. There’s a rowboat on the edge of the water. In the background, a duck, turtle, red squirrel, fox, and raven are walking single file over a wooden bridge that crosses the river. Most of the animals have coloured bandanas tied around their necks and a few are wearing hats. Up in the sky, there’s a satellite."}

::: notes
Openscapes is a movement and a community that I launched and have built together with my partner Erin Robinson.

Our flagship activity is mentoring research teams in environmental open data science.
Our role is welcome folks at the trailhead, meeting them where they are and helping them explore existing pathways and reduce bushwacking and as they navigate this landscape safely together.
Since 2018 we've helped over 75 teams move from sad lonely workflows like the animals on bottom left and into this rich landscape full of open source software, data, and communities.

"As fisheries scientists, we know that when we're in rough seas, it's important to keep the ship afloat AND get out of the storm. Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of email chains with 37 versions of the same attachment and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R"

::: notes
This quote from Adyan Rios is one example 

A big focus of Openscapes is helping researchers build psychologically safety within their teams, so that there is a strong culture of peer-learning and teaching, of asking questions, not assuming what people know or don't know, and trying to blur the lines of who can participate in technology.

<>The story I'd like to tell you now is with NASA.
:::

##  {background-video="images/R_beach_ball_flat_360p.mp4"}

::: notes
NASA has been collecting unbelievable amounts of data about Earth for decades
These data are freely available and help researchers tackle really critical questions about our planet, which is only more relevant with the impacts of climate change.

However, these data are stored by 12 different data centers around the US and researchers go to different data centers separately to download the data which is sometimes terrabytes to analyze it locally. (This is a huge burden on every user)

<> Now, as a result of many years of the preparation these NASA data centers are migrating these data to the Cloud hosted by AWS and others.

In anticipation and support of this, those 12 data centers are gearing up to support researchers transition their workflows to the Cloud

Erin had 10 years of experience working with NASA Earthdata and she brought NASA and openscapes together through a 3 year proposal that we cowrote and now lead together
And in that work, what we've done is develop this mentor community across the Earthscience data centers

In this first year we've loved working with 5 of the data centers and have helped them co-create and teach common tutorials to support researchers with Earthdata Cloud 
we'll dive into that a bit more

This was intimidating to me. This was the first proj I was a PI on, NASA as an org was intimdating, earth science remote sensing data is new
I was unfamiliar with Earth science as a research domain, the types of satellite imagery data NASA works with, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly.

Many NASA Earth scientists use python, and that's where the tutorial development was focused.

I asked if we could use Quarto for NASA-Openscapes and this became a really exciting collaboration with the Quarto team and the NASA Mentors

This Quarto site we made for the Fall 2021 Cloud Hackathon was where we really found traction in working together with the Mentors was dev'ing tutorials for the hackathon.

Through Openscapes gave them space and they dev'd a community, psych safety, getting comfortable learning new things, sharing imperfect work, giving feedback.
And quarto gave them a place to collab and present their work on a beautiful way for learners.

And, we're all able to work in whatever tool we're already comfortable with as we contributed to this cookbook, which is possible since you install quarto as a command line too like git; it's not an R package or a python package.
So with people working in their current tools and Quarto working in each case, we didn't need people to shift their software tools and instead could focus on upskilling around common pieces like Quarto and GitHub, but we didn't need to upset or shift everyone's software workflows, we could weave Quarto into existing workflows.

And this has also have dividends because while I said that the Earth science community is python-heavy what we've learned the more we work with this NASA Cloud data we see there is a significant R community and we're positioned to support them with this workflow we've developed because of Quarto it's not language-specific

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices.
Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output.
(Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

## Different on the outside, similar on the inside

***Building inclusion, empathy, and openness into our daily work***

**Engage:** Make the implicit explicit

**Empower:** Onboard learners as contributors

**Amplify:** Reuse (and credit!) good ideas
:::

::::

::: notes
The Openscapes Approach Guide is something we started developing as we worked with NASA Mentors as well as Mentors at NOAA Fisheries, Cal EPA, and academia

Quarto's given us a place to write down and codify how we've been learning to build inclusion, empathy and openness into our daily work, and they map on to how Openscapes focuses on engaging, empowering and amplifying people

It's let us make the implicit explicit and shine light on the work that Mentors do to teach, facilitate, coach, and build community 

And it also is integral in onboarding new mentors, both because of the content within it, and also as a way to learn quarto while contributing to it this guide and updating links, etc 

And it's also a way to amplify good ideas. We borrowed this idea from the Fay Lab Manual at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and are now seeing it at NOAA

Say out loud: I've talked a lot about NASA, but others: like the Fay Lab like NMFS, our team: Ileana, Stef 

Mosaic allows across languages and comfort


Over the last year there have been all these voices: NOAA, NASA, Fay Lab we've worked with - these groups are all addressing the climate emergency, and they're doing this more elegantly and collaboratively with Openscapes and Quarto.

We've given space to build psychological safety and place to collaborate and share ideas. We've been helping people transition behavior in a way that can be intimidating. 

Within this mosaic of voices, there is a range of technical skills, and it's important that that whole range can contribute and that a divide between who is technical or not, and this gap is widening.
To make this mosaic of voices actionable to tackle these big problems, we need strategies to close those gaps and blur those lines.

I don't want to say that Openscapes and Quarto's going to save us but the way it's enabled us to come together and do big work is going to. It's lowering the barriers and blurring lines of who can contribute their ideas and insights.

## Demo: Quarto in the Visual Editor

And one way the mosiac of voices is enabled is through VE

-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates.
-   Also nice for markdown-savvy writers

::: demo
-   open project in RStudio
-   Show tips: "I learned this from Mine while we were preparing our slides"
-   Images, Tables
-   Call-outs
-   Citations: DOIs

Julie:

<> So Quarto is really powerful for seasoned coders and Markdown users, as well as a friendly introduction for new coders that has more "guardrails". And that's important. I've showed you this awesome tech and I want to tie it back into our work with Openscapes -

## Reimagining challenges together {background-image="images/2019ESWPoster316x24MTeditnoNP_cropped_sm_er.jpeg"}


::: notes
See across levels of "finish". sharing imperfect work - the way that we work, the softwared
the workflows they've learned to use

Sharing openly, quickly, imperfectly - by bringinging together our way of working with Quarto, supporing mentors that are more rapid sharers. (tie to climate emergency and quarto)
Quarto is theProduct/place, for our process, people

We had the people and the process but we didn't have the place. When Quarto snapped into place, we were able to reimagine how we work togethre.


Contributing openly as a way to work + removing barriers

Like we said it's openly it's a movement. Like All We Can save we can't go it alone. 


And it's been cool to see how Quarto has enabled us to not only reuse things like tutorials but also ideas like how to design and facilitate learning events.
One of the things here is that open science is a way to work.
It's not just about products, it's about process.
It's about people.

Transition: So these examples so far have been about openly creating documentation for your team, which is a big part of reimagining how we work.
And it's also an opportunity to extend this in other resources as well.

Just want to emphasize the power of removing barriers and blurring lines.
of who's a coder or not

Blurring between fed agencies, between researchers, between people who do and don't identify as coders, what lang you use, how technical you are

Mosiac of voices: we need everyone

Growing the mosaic.
meeting people where they were I reimagined how I worked with groups.
I learned how to work with groups.
**Transition of behavior is the power of Openscapes.**


Blurred: End the mosiac: through this work for this last year, we've been able to remove barrier and I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you.
Looking forward to this collective community contributes to this mosiac

Lights at Night Rivers - instead: patchwork of landuse.
Landsat.
Mosiac.

This is just the beginning.
There's so much more to write, so much more to do, we need the Earthrise quote.
Do more than cop, grounded, steady, ready

when it comes to who is a coder and not and how we value contribution.

The more we talk about this and role model what's possible, the more actionable we all become.

And throughout all of this is the idea that we can collaborate across coding comfort levels.
It's been really neat to see how Quarto can not only reduce barriers across coding languages like python and R, but also differnt experience levels.

 This is a screenshot of the new Visual Editor that is part of the RStudio IDE, and it's something we've been experimenting with more and more.
We've found this to be a really nice way to write prose even for those familiar with Markdown, but it's also a friendlier way for people to get to know the tools.

This is about not assuming technical skills, but creating an safe culture where they can say what they don't know and reinforce a peer-learning & teaching culture, and using tooling that is friendly for new and seasoned coders alike.

Transition: Let me demo Quarto with the Visual editor - it's really exciting to blur those lines between who identifies as a coder or not using these tools collaboratively.

## Coda

-   R Markdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages

Just as we chose to go to the moon<br> We know it's never too soon<br> To choose hope.<br> We choose to do more than cope<br> With climate change<br> We choose to end it---<br> We refuse to lose.<br> Together we do this and more<br> Not because it's very easy or nice<br> But because it is necessary,<br> Because with every dawn we carry<br> the weight of the fate of this celestial body orbiting a star.<br> And as heavy as that weight sounded, it doesn't hold us down,<br> But it keeps us grounded, steady, ready,<br> Because an environmental movement of this size<br> Is simply another form of an earthrise.<br>
