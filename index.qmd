Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have both been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching with it since its earliest days and my Openscapes team is the first external users of Quarto. As Mine and I have experimented with it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

**Mine:**

Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year. I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke. The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching. Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles. Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation. More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well. So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## R Markdown ecosystem {transition="zoom"}

![](images/rmd_ecosystem.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
**Mine:**

Julie mentioned unifying the R Markdown ecosystem so let's dig a bit more into what that means... Think of all the packages from the R Markdown universe that many of you've come to love and rely on over the years. Each package addresses a different need and offers a different output: for example, you can use blogdown or distill for creating websites and blogs, bookdown for writing a book, rticles for writing journal articles, etc.
:::

## Next generation R Markdown {transition="zoom"}

![](images/horst_quarto_ball.png){width="900px" fig-align="center"}

**Mine:**

Quarto unifies the functionality from a wide range of packages from the R Markdown ecosystem, building on Pandoc on the technical side and years of experience developing, maintaining, and tweaking these packages as well as community feedback on the human side.

## Under the hood

::: illustration
**Illustration:** Request from Allison: Diagram at https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/hello-quarto-sdssg/#/running-code
:::

::: notes
**Mine:**

A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?" The main difference is that with R Markdown, the R package rmarkdown does the heavy lifting of the orchestration of going from source code (the Rmd file) to output, using knitr for evaluating the code chunks. With Quarto, the Quarto command line interface (or CLI, for short) does the orchestration of processing executable code chunks with either knitr or jupyter and then converting the resulting markdown file to the desired output. While this is technically impressive, I'll be honest, it's not necessarily what sparked my interest in Quarto in the first place.

::: notes
**Mine:** What did spark my interest was how easy, or, let's not say easy, I don't like that word in reference to any new technology, but how straightforward it is with Quarto to move between "things". As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

There are mountains in the background. The Openscapes hex logo is in the top left hand corner. In the foreground there are many animals: hermit crab working alone on a laptop, a sad rabbit on a laptop under a raincloud, a frustrated skunk on a laptop under a raincloud. Just over a bush is another group of animals: a fox with a welcome sign stands with a hedgehog holding map brochures In front of a larger park map. The fox and hedgehog are in front of a group of animals: a heron, a squirrel, a mouse holding a notebook, a raccoon, a snake, and a quail. In the midground, there’s a turtle, deer, owl and beaver by the river that has stepping stone rocks across. A roadrunner, lizard, blue bird, and rabbit, are walking down a path together, one of the other paths is blocked by a log. There’s a rowboat on the edge of the water. In the background, a duck, turtle, red squirrel, fox, and raven are walking single file over a wooden bridge that crosses the river. Most of the animals have coloured bandanas tied around their necks and a few are wearing hats. Up in the sky, there’s a satellite."}

::: notes
Openscapes is a movement and a community that I launched and have built together with my partner Erin Robinson.

Our flagship activity is mentoring research teams in environmental open data science. Our role is welcome folks at the trailhead, meeting them where they are and helping them explore existing pathways and reduce bushwacking and as they navigate this landscape safely together. Since 2018 we've helped over 75 teams move from sad lonely workflows like the animals on bottom left and into this rich landscape full of open source software, data, and communities.

::: notes
This quote from Adyan Rios is one example

A big focus of Openscapes is helping researchers build psychologically safety within their teams, so that there is a strong culture of peer-learning and teaching, of asking questions, not assuming what people know or don't know, and trying to blur the lines of who can participate in technology.

\<\>The story I'd like to tell you now is with NASA.
:::

##  {background-video="images/R_beach_ball_flat_360p.mp4"}

::: notes
NASA has been collecting unbelievable amounts of data about Earth for decades These data are freely available and help researchers tackle really critical questions about our planet, which is only more relevant with the impacts of climate change.

However, these data are stored by 12 different data centers around the US and researchers go to different data centers separately to download the data which is sometimes terrabytes to analyze it locally. (This is a huge burden on every user)

\<\> Now, as a result of many years of the preparation these NASA data centers are migrating these data to the Cloud hosted by AWS and others.

In anticipation and support of this, those 12 data centers are gearing up to support researchers transition their workflows to the Cloud

Erin had 10 years of experience working with NASA Earthdata and she brought NASA and openscapes together through a 3 year proposal that we cowrote and now lead together And in that work, what we've done is develop this mentor community across the Earthscience data centers

Many NASA Earth scientists use python, and that's where the tutorial development was focused.

I feel like R and especially R Markdown is a total superpower, I honestly I think differently about what's possible in science because of R Markdown. Quarto let me bring that experience and confidence to NASA Openscapes.

I had been collaborating with J.J. Allaire for the past few years and I knew Quarto was emerging right when we needed it. I asked if we could use Quarto for NASA-Openscapes and this became a really exciting collaboration with the Quarto team and the NASA Mentors

This Quarto site we made for the Fall 2021 Cloud Hackathon was where we really found traction in working together with the Mentors was dev'ing tutorials for the hackathon.

Through Openscapes gave them space and they dev'd a community, psych safety, getting comfortable learning new things, sharing imperfect work, giving feedback. And quarto gave them a place to collab and present their work on a beautiful way for learners.

And, we're all able to work in whatever tool we're already comfortable with as we contributed to this cookbook, which is possible since you install quarto as a command line too like git; it's not an R package or a python package. So with people working in their current tools and Quarto working in each case, we didn't need people to shift their software tools and instead could focus on upskilling around common pieces like Quarto and GitHub, but we didn't need to upset or shift everyone's software workflows, we could weave Quarto into existing workflows.

And this has also have dividends because while I said that the Earth science community is python-heavy what we've learned the more we work with this NASA Cloud data we see there is a significant R community and we're positioned to support them with this workflow we've developed because of Quarto it's not language-specific

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output.

**Empower:** Onboard learners as contributors

**Amplify:** Reuse (and credit!) good ideas
:::
:::

::: notes
Openscapes has been doing its own level of trying to do culture shift with science, focused on engaging, empowering, and amplifying a mosaic of voices in the environmental research community, and focused building inclusion, empathy, and openness into our daily work.

And Quarto is enabling and accelerating part of that paradigm shift because it gives a place for the mosiac of voices to write and share ideas.

This Openscapes Approach Guide has no code in it - it's something Erin and I started developing to codify how we work and to onboard ourselves to things we do every few months and want to do consistenly. It also gives visibility and value to the work that is involved to mentor, teach, facilitate, coach, and build community which are a big part of what we do.

And then it has also been a way to empower new learners. Last year when we started working with NASA we also onboarded mentors from the California EPA, NOAA Fisheries, protocols.io, as well as Ileana whose quote you heard and Stef Butland. They learned from the content of the Approach Guide, and also learned how to contribute to it with quarto and GitHub

And it's also a way to amplify good ideas. We borrowed this idea from the Fay Lab Manual at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, as well as modeled throughout open science communities in different ways includeing eScience, Mozilla, Pangeo and of course the R community

I don't want to say that Openscapes and Quarto's going to save us but the way it's enabled us to come together and do big work is going to. It's lowering the barriers and blurring lines of who can contribute their ideas and insights.

And Quarto has let us scale this mosaic of voices and make these ideas actionable in a variety of ways.

Say out loud: I've talked a lot about NASA, but others: like the Fay Lab like NMFS, our team: Ileana, Stef

Mosaic allows across languages and comfort

The fact that Quarto works across languages like Python and R is so useful for us, and it's been equally valuable for this to work across coding comfort levels. Many people do not identify as coders - in fact training in data is one of the largest unmet needs for environmental researchers and those are the ones in a data-intensive science program. Quarto helps us blur the lines

but it's been really useful for others. Can move this forward

We've given space to build psychological safety and place to collaborate and share ideas. We've been helping people transition behavior in a way that can be intimidating.

Within this mosaic of voices, there is a range of technical skills, and it's important that that whole range can contribute and that a divide between who is technical or not, and this gap is widening. To make this mosaic of voices actionable to tackle these big problems, we need strategies to close those gaps and blur those lines.

**Reducing barriers, blurring lines**

\

**Contribution formats:** books, websites, etc

\

**Science communication:** share earlier and as you want, openly

\

**Open science:** not just products but process and people

\

***Who*** **contributes:** who is psychologically safe and supported

::: notes
This is about reimagining how we contribute as a mosiac of voices and how we value contribution.

These are just a few. Changes how you think

Across not only coding languages, but across coding comforts.

Don't mean to say that the VE is only for new learners. It is for markdown-savvy writers as well. In fact I know J.J. Allaire prefers to do his writing in the VE

And one way the mosiac of voices is enabled is through VE

Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates. Also nice for markdown-savvy writers

**Reimagining how we tackle challenges means integrating new tech, new behavior, new culture.**

::: notes
See across levels of "finish". sharing imperfect work - the way that we work, the softwared the workflows they've learned to use

Sharing openly, quickly, imperfectly - by bringinging together our way of working with Quarto, supporing mentors that are more rapid sharers. (tie to climate emergency and quarto) Quarto is theProduct/place, for our process, people

We had the people and the process but we didn't have the place. When Quarto snapped into place, we were able to reimagine how we work togethre.

Contributing openly as a way to work + removing barriers

Like we said it's openly it's a movement. Like All We Can save we can't go it alone.

And it's been cool to see how Quarto has enabled us to not only reuse things like tutorials but also ideas like how to design and facilitate learning events. One of the things here is that open science is a way to work. It's not just about products, it's about process. It's about people.

Transition: So these examples so far have been about openly creating documentation for your team, which is a big part of reimagining how we work. And it's also an opportunity to extend this in other resources as well.

Bri: Openscapes is doing its own level of trying to do culture shift with science, focused on building inclusion, empathy, and openness into our daily work. And Quarto is enabling and accelerating part of that paradigm shift because it helps bring this mosiac of voices together. has and how it goes across languages It's been really useful for us but it's been really useful for others. Can move this forward

Just want to emphasize the power of removing barriers and blurring lines. of who's a coder or not

Blurring between fed agencies, between researchers, between people who do and don't identify as coders, what lang you use, how technical you are

Mosiac of voices: we need everyone

Growing the mosaic. meeting people where they were I reimagined how I worked with groups. I learned how to work with groups. **Transition of behavior is the power of Openscapes.**

Blurred: End the mosiac: through this work for this last year, we've been able to remove barrier and I really appreciate having this opp to share this with all of you. Looking forward to this collective community contributes to this mosiac

Lights at Night Rivers - instead: patchwork of landuse. Landsat. Mosiac.

This is just the beginning. There's so much more to write, so much more to do, we need the Earthrise quote. Do more than cop, grounded, steady, ready

when it comes to who is a coder and not and how we value contribution.

The more we talk about this and role model what's possible, the more actionable we all become.

And throughout all of this is the idea that we can collaborate across coding comfort levels. It's been really neat to see how Quarto can not only reduce barriers across coding languages like python and R, but also differnt experience levels.

This is a screenshot of the new Visual Editor that is part of the RStudio IDE, and it's something we've been experimenting with more and more. We've found this to be a really nice way to write prose even for those familiar with Markdown, but it's also a friendlier way for people to get to know the tools.

This is about not assuming technical skills, but creating an safe culture where they can say what they don't know and reinforce a peer-learning & teaching culture, and using tooling that is friendly for new and seasoned coders alike.

Transition: Let me demo Quarto with the Visual editor - it's really exciting to blur those lines between who identifies as a coder or not using these tools collaboratively.

## Coda

-   R Markdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages
