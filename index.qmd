# Julie title slide speaker notes: Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have both been using Quarto for over a last year. As we've experimented with using it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're excited to talk with you today about how it improves the way we share, collaborate, teach, and reimagine. In short, we're excited to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

# Hello, Quarto?

Julie: But also, we know you have questions. We did too. Why Quarto? What is it? What are the motivations? And how does it relate to the tools you already use and workflows you already have?

**Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem**
:::

::: notes
Quarto unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem. It builds on 10 years of insight from RMarkdown.

It unifies the RMarkdown ecosystem in a way that people who love RMarkdown will find little points of friction removed, little things that were different between for example bookdown and xaringan, now have a common approach. It's easier to share, it's easier to teach.
And it extends the RMarkdown ecosystem in a way that people who do not yet know RMarkdown have a really friendly tool that interoperates with how they already work. And this really influences how we can all collaborate and reimagine together.

:::

::: notes
Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year. I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke. The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching. Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles. Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation. More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well. So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## Next generation R Markdown

![](images/rmd-to-quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Mine: It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem. Beyond unification, Quarto also makes available attractive and handy features like tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc. consistently across the various outputs.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

::: demo
**This will be replaced with screen recording.**

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
-   yaml completion and yaml errors

-   Qmd -\> knitr/jupyter -\> pandoc: Quarto CLI doing the orchestration
:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving between formats within Quarto is straightforward

-   Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website)
-   It's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

::: notes
Julie: If there are 3 ways to describe me and what I do, it is that I'm an environmental scientist at the intersection of actionable science, data science, and open science, and where i shine is through mentoring, teaching, and community empowerment. 

I've made this my job through Openscapes

It's an understatement to say that the R community changed my life; My path can be summarized in these 5 images: 

The Ocean Health Index, where my marine ecology research team learned the hard way that we couldn't reproduce our own work with our default approaches to data analysis and collaboration.

R (RMarkdown and the tidyverse) completely played an underpinning role in our transition to better science in less time 

A Mozilla Fellowship helped me launch Openscapes and shift my career away from research and towards supporting research teams 

And Erin Robinson partnered developed it into a sustainable and scalable model

Community-taught, team-practiced

::: notes
Openscapes about moving from lonely research to open science and teamwork is really based on my experience as a researcher, moving from lonely individual research to finding my teams and being empowered by open science. 

So the main origins for Openscapes come from the OHI and the R community, these folks are my mentors, my Yodas. Learning open data science from these communities and the practicing them as a team has been game-changing for the way I think about what’s possible with science. 

So I’ll give a brief background about these origins of openscapes
:::


## Openscapes Approach {.smaller}

![](images/horst_pew_tools_practice_mindset.jpg){fig-align="left" width="50%"}

::: {.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width="520"}
- **Researcher-centered, focused on teams.**
Practice and feel safe working openly with yourself and your team; then ease into more.

- **Create space & place to explore & learn.**  Cohort Calls, Seaside Chats, Co-Working; GitHub, R, Python, Quarto, Google Drive, Slack; Efficiency & Inclusion Tips.

- **Cultivate relationships & real connections.**
Welcoming folks w/ diverse backgrounds; meeting where they are; skills to empower immediate work; kinder science.

- **Open culture: Learning, teaching, iterating.** 
Not a checklist - a continual practice. Imperfect, messy. Takes time.
:::



::: notes
We mentor environmental and Earth science teams
government, non-profit, and academic groups Openscapes is about better science for future us. We help teams transition to inclusive open science workflows This is visualized: We mentor teams to better tackle their questions by modernizing shared practices, underpinned by existing tools.

-   Mentor, facilitator, teacher, coach, community organizer

-   Project lead, tech infrastructure setup

-   Merger (and creator) of merge conflicts

-   Open source advocate

-   Researcher advocate

Julie: We mentor teams We create a learning culture, break down silos and loneliness creating space - people; creating place - tech **Better science for future us**

For reimagining habits and culture change

Openscapes helps research teams Collab around data. Tech diffs, experience. Inclusion, behavior change.

::: notes
Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. Our main focus is to empower research teams. A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.
"that's Erin and me"
Transition - we've worked with 70+ research teams, and many of them have been marine ecologists. What this looks like for them is said beautifully by Adyan Rios, where she says -

Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of forwarded emails with 37 versions of the same Excel file and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R. 

We mentor these teams and help them find that trailhead as they start to explore existing pathways in that open science landscape.

::: notes
We work directly with researchers, mentoring them to help them collaborate and incorporate existing open source software into their analytical workflows
Most of these teams so far have been marine and environmental researchers, who largely use R.

# Openscapes' Quarto story begins with NASA {.julie}

🚀🌏

::: notes
Openscapes' Quarto story begins with NASA. It's amazing to be here on this stage and say that out loud. 
Let me give you some background here to help describe how we got here. 

First of all, yes NASA is about exploring Outer Space, but it's also understanding our own Planet, Earth.

Phytoplankton Bloom
Baltic Sea
In this Landsat 7 image from 2005, massive congregations of greenish phytoplankton swirl in the dark water around Gotland, a
Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. Phytoplankton are microscopic marine plants that form the first link in nearly all ocean food chains.
Population explosions, or blooms, of phytoplankton, like the one shown here, occur when deep currents bring nutrients up to sunlit
surface waters, fueling the growth and reproduction of these tiny, photosynthesizing organisms.

Earth scientists and geoscientists use images like these to understand complex problems like how drought is affecting land use and agriculture, how long-range transport of wind and dust affects urban health. This means they to do really data-intensive analysis through time and space 

The Terra satellite captured this image of wadis in southeastern Jordan in 2001. The Arabic word wadi means a gulley or riverbed
that is usually dry except after drenching, seasonal rains. In this image, meandering wadis have combined to form dense, branching
networks across the stark, arid landscape.

::: notes
Quarto let me bring my superpower to Python/NASA. I had been collaborating with J.J. Allaire for several years about RMarkdown, and I knew that he was working on something called quarto that could interface between R and Python. As the NASA Openscapes project got going in Spring 2021 I asked if we could use it. Both J.J. and the quarto dev team and the NASA mentors were willing to take this on together, and we became the first external-to-RStudio users of Quarto. It's been just an incredible collaboration: we've been able to use Quarto to interface between R and Python worlds and also contribute to some of the design of Quarto based on our needs and use.

Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made. It's beautiful, right out of the box with the default settings.
It's a collection of how to guides and tutorials - we could organize what we had and make placeholders for where we saw gaps as we developed them together. It helped us all come together as a team, from across silos, with different skills, comfort with coding, different coding language, different tech. Quarto let us see an end-goal in our mind, and then work in one place, and learn to contribute with confidence.

# Teach

![](images/quadrants-teach.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Use Quarto to accomplish existing goals {.smaller}

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

Reimagining science means approaching open science as a movement. Talk of open science is often about products, but it's also about process. It's about daily habits and workflows, and really interrogating who is included, in terms of tech and culture. And who is safe to participate and share and how to make sure this is part of paid work and not extra that deepens inequality. 

It's the way science should be done, but who can participate? Both from a tech and culture perspective

We are so inspired by folks in the open science movement, TODO from NASEM, data providers, open source software developers, teachers, RSEs, community managers,including many of you who are here. 

And beyond Open Science, we are hugely inspired by Climate Justice, Get Out the Vote movements thinking about how to onboard and welcome new people to the movment, + open web

if you are already into open science, open source tools like Quarto helps you execute open science. And if you're not already into open science, open source tools like Quarto can be an entryway and motivator to get engaged
Urgency: Why this matters. Collaborate with people sooner, co-create/reuse not reinvent. Connect the skills to the values with the urgency.

There's more emphasis on open science and this is the way science should be done. All these things about open up your process \> one of the challenges have been tools that allow you to easily do these things the things. These allow you to do thie

- As Erin and I were building Openscapes, needed to write things down. For us, for scaling, and to give visibilty and value to the work we're doing, which is a really powerful interface between coaching, mentoring, facilitating, project management, community engagement, and modern tech, data science, cloud computing and big data, for environmental change.
- Quarto gave us that place; I'd made many books before but included code
- Lowered the barrier. Installed RStudio, used the Visual Editor together. before she learned how to code, and may have given her that confidence she needed - has since learned R, Python, and Matlab
- Dev'd mentors community - a way to onboard people and help them contribute. 
- This is an idea we learned from Gavin Fay's Lab Manual, which his team developed as Openscapes Champions. 
- Will be repeating this specifically for NMFS, a work in progress. moving from the Wiki, help give visibilty and value
- As our documentation grew, Thinking about Modular lessons - our intro to Quarto websites tutorial is stand-alone, small. but linked from Approach Guide and from NASA Cookbook.

## DEMO: Visual editor

Leverage tooling that reduces barriers

::: demo
-   open project in RStudio
-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates.
-   Also nice for markdown-savvy writers
-   Show tips: "I learned this from Mine while we were preparing our slides"
-   Images, Tables
-   Call-outs
-   Citations: DOIs

## Coda

-   RMarkdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages

# Quarto examples and resources

## Call to Action: try it out! {.smaller}

-   Quarto docs
-   Mine's Toronto talk
-   Julie's Quarto tutorial
-   Openscapes Community Call
-   Sample sites, books, etc.
    -   mine's course sites

## Hi, I'm Julie

-   Long-time user of R Markdown, and also Quarto
-   Changed my work-life and my life-life
-   Theme: collaborating

::: notes
Julie: So excited to be here. I am a long-time and prolific user of RMarkdown, and Quarto and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults. This as you'll see has been helping me push and blur the boundaries of environmental science, open source, and teaching. What I'll share today is a huge team-effort with many colleagues, that also builds from many folks in the R and open science communities.

## Openscapes {background-image="images/horst_openscapes_champions.jpg" background-size="600px"}

::: notes
Julie: In the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. But a lot of us feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. Through the Champions program we will help you explore and navigate these pathways; you'll find common approaches with your team as you identify your trailhead and safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as you go. We mentor and developed and have iterated a whole flywheel for culture change

## Quarto enables interoperability and collaboration

Streamlines teamwork

-   shared vision: code and text together beautifully
-   interoperability with tech
-   interoperability with people

::: notes
But when Erin Robinson joined Openscapes she brought expertise in scaling programs and making them sustainable. She introduced this idea of the Flywheel of the steps needed to really create lasting culture change. 

It involves focusing beyond delivering the Champions program; and how there is a whole series of steps that interplay...

Transition - we've worked with 70+ research teams, and what this looks like for them is said beautifully by Dr. Adyan Rios:

## Create space 

Prioritize time.

Build trust, psychological safety, inclusion

Ask how people work, where they're stuck, what they know.

Foster a learning culture. And a teaching culture. Empathy. Growth Mindset. Meet people where they are.

::: notes
Learning. messy. Don't need to have a plan, just you want to do better. make the space. Takes time to learn and do, amazing what folks can do together. Across backgrounds, skills, expertise.

Managers at NASA, NOAA, faculty at universities. Supporting people's time to learn. open science must be part of people's paid work.

NOAA Cohort right now with 9 Supervisors participating.

Necessary part of reimagining: Time.
:::

::: notes
This might be dated now 1. Share your ideas earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture 2. Reuse: create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science. 3. bring inclusion into your daily work (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs

## Create place

Quarto has been really key for us with NASA Openscapes (also JupyterHub, GitHub, Google Docs)

Where we put things, what contributing looks like
