Thank you so much, we're excited to be here! 
Mine and I have been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching and contributing to quarto it since its earliest days and Openscapes has been the first external users of Quarto. As we've woven it into our work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to welcome you to Quarto.

# Hello, Quarto? {.title-top-light background-image="images/horst-quarto-meteor-transparent.png" aria-label="Quarto logo depicted as a meteor against a white background with a tail comprised of bright stars."}

::: notes
But also, we know you have questions. We did too. What is Quarto? Why isQuarto? And how does it relate to R Markdown and the workflows you already have? \<\> Well -

::: notes
It unifies it for people who love R Markdown by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends it for people who don't know RMarkdown by being a friendly way to work reproducibly and publish documents that have text and code in the same place

The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating dramatically better.

--> It handles inputs in multiple languages, and outputs in multiple formats, all going through the same machinery.

First Mine will focus on how Quarto unifies the R Markdown ecosystem through sharing and teaching

##  {#outline-2 .centered data-menu-title="Outline 2" auto-animate="true"}

::: notes
Then I will focus on how Quarto extends the R Markdown ecosystem through collaborating and reimagining

##  {#outline-3 .centered data-menu-title="Outline 3" auto-animate="true"}

We're excited to get started! So lets starts off with how Quarto enables sharing. Over to you Mine

# {#coda data-menu-title="Coda" background-image="images/horst_quarto_penguins_thankyou.png"}

::: notes
We've talked about our experiences using Quarto and all the problems it has helped us solve and reimagine, but while Quarto is stable and ready for use, it's also just a baby that you too can be a part of its growth. So start using and start chiming in with feedback... or build an extension... this is a sunrise not sunset.

Just as we chose to go to the moon<br> We know it's never too soon<br> To choose hope.<br> We choose to do more than cope<br> With climate change<br> We choose to end it---<br> We refuse to lose.<br> Together we do this and more<br> Not because it's very easy or nice<br> But because it is necessary,<br> Because with every dawn we carry<br> the weight of the fate of this celestial body orbiting a star.<br> And as heavy as that weight sounded, it doesn't hold us down,<br> But it keeps us grounded, steady, ready,<br> Because an environmental movement of this size<br> Is simply another form of an earthrise.<br>
