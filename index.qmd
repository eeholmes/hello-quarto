Thank you so much, We're excited to be here! Mine and I have both been using Quarto for the last year; she has been teaching with it since its earliest days and my Openscapes team is the first external users of Quarto. As Mine and I have experimented with it in our own work we realize we love it, and we're thrilled to introduce and welcome you to Quarto.

::: notes
**Julie:** But also, we know you have questions. Mine and I did too. What is Quarto? Why Quarto? And how does it relate to R Markdown and to other tools you already use and workflows you already have? \<\> Well -

::: notes
It unifies the R Markdown ecosystem by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends it beyond R as a friendly way to work reproducibly with text and code in the same place

\<\> It builds on 10 years of insight from R Markdown -

The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.

\<\> It handles inputs in multiple languages, and outputs in multiple formats, all going through the same machinery.

\<\> In our talk today, we'll introduce you to Quarto with stories and demos.

## Coda

-   R Markdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages

## Earthrise by Amanda Gorman {.smaller}

Excerpted from [Earthrise full text and video](https://www.sierraclub.org/los-padres/blog/2021/02/earthrise-poem-amanda-gorman)

<br>

So, earth, pale blue dot<br> We will fail you not.<br>

Just as we chose to go to the moon<br> We know it's never too soon<br> To choose hope.<br> We choose to do more than cope<br> With climate change<br> We choose to end it---<br> We refuse to lose.<br> Together we do this and more<br> Not because it's very easy or nice<br> But because it is necessary,<br> Because with every dawn we carry<br> the weight of the fate of this celestial body orbiting a star.<br> And as heavy as that weight sounded, it doesn't hold us down,<br> But it keeps us grounded, steady, ready,<br> Because an environmental movement of this size<br> Is simply another form of an earthrise.<br>
