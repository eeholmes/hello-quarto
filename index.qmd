# Intro

## Hi, I'm Julie

-   Long-time user of RMarkdown, and also Quarto
-   Changed my work-life and my life-life
-   Theme: collaborating

::: aside
Julie: So excited to be here. Long-time user of RMarkdown, and Quarto - I am a prolific user and love how out-of-the box they are; I can use them for communicating about research, teaching, and collaborating using mostly the defaults. This as you'll see has been helping me push and blur the boundaries of environmental science, open source, and teaching
:::

## Hi, I'm Mine

*Unpolished ideas:*

Mine: will talk about left side

Julie: will talk about right side; Both: share demos, stories, FAQ's

# Quarto is for people who love RMarkdown

## Next generation R Markdown

-   It combines/unifies some "down" packages
-   It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (python, Julia). provides that functionality even if you're not coming from R ecosystem

::: aside
*Illustration: "down" hex logos*

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

*This slide will be replaced with a screen recording.*

::: demo
-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a \_quarto.yml, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*
:::

::: aside
Mine:

## FAQ: knit vs render?

(this comes after changing the extension from .rmd to .qmd)

::: aside
*illustration: maybe a graphic and a arrow pointing at a high-level where it's different*

Mine:
:::

## FAQ: from Jenny or Jo?

## Story:

-   teaching background
-   teaching winter course - anecdote from art history student?
-   Why is this interesting, is it diff from teaching Rmd? easier, harder? Not different?

OR: diff formats within R (web, slides, course web) I go between the formats a lot (Rmd 8 ways)

# Quarto is for people who have never used RMarkdown

## NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook

Image: screenshot of quarto book

::: aside
Julie: this is the first Quarto site I made. 3 cool things about this.
:::

## 1. Code & text together beautifully

Image: screenshot of quarto book, contributing page

::: aside
Julie: 1. it looks familiar coming from RMarkdown. It's beautiful...

-   first real content in it: taught others how to install quarto and contribute, knew it would change but that's ok, the beauty of quarto, it's dynamic, you don't feel stuck or static
:::

## 2. Interoperability with tech

creating collections

Image: screenshot of portion of `_quarto.yml`: .ipynbs not .Rmds

::: aside
Julie: 2. language compatibility - using quarto with a python-heavy crowd I'm able to build from what I've learned with R and share with the python crowd (flexibility in the tooling)
:::

## 2b. Interoperability with tech

Image: screenshot .qmd with python and R code

::: aside
Julie: 2. language compatibility - using quarto to support researchers early - first dev is in python but not limited
:::

## 3. Interoperability with people

aka collaboration

Image: screenshots of Zoom

::: aside
3.  cool collaboration with J.J. and the quarto team AND NASA Openscapes.
:::

## NASA Openscapes Framework

Supporting NASA Earth science research teams\' migration to the cloud

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   find the common
-   reuse existing
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   contribute to fill gaps
-   foster a learning culture
:::
:::

::: aside
Julie: This book is part of a 3-year project with NASA to support scientific researcher teams using NASA Earthdata as they migrate their workflows to the cloud.
:::

## DEMO: Flexibility in the tooling

*This slide will be replaced with a screen recording.*

::: demo
-   Render Mine's example site in JupyterHub, quarto preview
-   Add `.ipynb`, workflow
-   Also: show `earthdata` python code chunk and how it passes to R code chunk \> this has been huge for researchers in the cloud
-   Also open in VS Code, show `.qmd` (cmd-shift-k to render \[attention to other tool chains available\])
-   You install Quarto with a CLI, (like git) so you can work with whatever tooling you want
:::

::: aside
Julie:
:::

## NASA Openscapes and Quarto  

1.  code and text together beautifully
2.  interoperability with tech
3.  interoperability with people

Workflow philosophy (and a document type)

::: aside
Julie: summary following demo to transition to Mine
:::

# Quarto enables new ways of sharing & organization

## Use quarto to accomplish existing goals

-   Consistent and transparent/obvious org across projects (teaching website)
-   Journal articles (research)
-   Personal website? Or R4ds book
-   Screenshots of each, folder org on the bottom\

::: aside
Mine:
:::

## some title...

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing

-   If it's not easy to make a course website, you won't
-   Tooling that makes it easy to share with the world
-   New way of getting credit
-   Open sharing of knowledge. Other people can just take
-   When it comes time for promotion/review, I say here it is
-   Last 10% to tweak it for your context

::: aside
Mine:
:::

## DEMO: Part 2

*This slide will be replaced with a screen recording.*

::: demo
-   visual editor

-   Short - "a few things I've learned transitioning Rmd -\> quarto",

-   Now to be a bit more principled about the transition (Change extension .rmd to .qmd and render to see it's fine)

-   Change \_bookdown.yml to \_quarto.yml

-   My bookdown H1 headers were markdown `#Like This`; quarto book will build but the rest of the headers don't show up on the right TOC. change to yaml `title: Like This`. Also will look right in the viewer

## Story 2

::: aside
Mine:
:::

# Quarto enables new ways of reuse & reimagining

## Use quarto to be creative about emerging needs/new goals

(image)

::: aside
Julie: enabling sharing and organization across tooling and people (like Mine just showed) means it's easier to reuse and reimagine.

(creating new problems/solutions because quarto existion)- new ways of thinking that aren\'t standard practices. Book websites to collaborate on? Not really how we thought about things before

this really shows up with Openscapes
:::

## What we do at Openscapes

**Engage mentors • Empower research teams • Scale open practices**

-   people infrastructure - creating space.

-   tech infrastructure - creating place.

Create a learning culture, strengthen the open movement

::: aside
Julie: we help teams collaborate, upskill, become resilient. 3 big things:
:::

## 1. Share earlier

Image: Series book [Openscapes Lesson Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/)

A way to welcome folks to join you

::: aside
Julie: share earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd)

Was true
:::

## 2. Build inclusion into your daily work

image: Fay Lab Manual

-   [Gavin Fay lab manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)

::: aside
Julie: Onboarding (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs. little things.

::: aside
Create a learning culture
:::
:::

## 3. Reuse: co-create-once-use-often

*placeholder image - NMFS-Openscapes?*

-   [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/) (inspired by Gavin)

![](images/mentors-screenshot.png){fig-align="center" width="20%"}

::: aside
Julie: Co-create. create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science.

seeing this enabled with NASA and quarto - but also NOAA Fisheries: https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/index.html

## Fostering a culture of reuse

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Interoperability (language, tooling, people) --\>
-   Enabling collaborations, transferrable skills
-   Can collaborate with people sooner.
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling \> culture change bc repro and sharing
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/horst_pew_tools_practice_mindset.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}
:::

::: aside
Julie: Openscapes helps teams develop practices that are underpinned by tools. Quarto creates "place"
:::

## Demo / Showcase culture of reuse:

::: demo
-   open one in RStudio
-   Visual Editor - friendly for non-coders. Reimagine who participates
:::

-   

::: aside
Julie: Culture of trust, less reinventing. Meets someone like me where they are and supports them. (Revisit from useR)
:::

## Open science as a movement

*placeholder slide* - why this matters. Collaborate with people sooner.

![](images/all-we-can-save-screenshot.png){fig-align="center" width="20%"}

::: aside
Julie:
:::

## Openscapes: reimagining with Quarto

1.  share earlier (can I see it? yes) - Series book (existed openly even before was fully dev'd) Create a learning culture
2.  bring inclusion into your daily practice (make the implicit explicit) - Gavin manual "Redefining relationships -blurred lines not frontstage/backstage, co-create, & update onboarding docs
3.  Reuse: create-once-use-often. less reinventing; focus your time on the science.

::: aside
Julie: summary slide and transition
:::

## "Here's 12 more things we didn't get to showcase"

*Penguin juggling, excitement*

-   \"Diagram feature\" maybe code \| output

-   Works with Shiny - that\'s all to say

-   Quarto pub? What it accomplishes \| what it looks like

-   Yaml completion in chunk options

-   Informative yaml errors

-   Freeze \> blog posts, jupyter notebooks

-   Book chapters opening as you\'d expect them to

-   Table \> 2 tables next to each otherXS

## Closing

-   RMarkdown has helped code be part of something you share
-   Tooling that makes things easy can help be culture change
-   Tooling culture change bc repro and sharing
-   Quarto could help bring about culture change across languages

# Quarto examples and resources

## some title...

The following slides won't be in the final talk

## (Champions landscape)

![](images/horst_openscapes_champions.jpg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

::: notes
Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. Our main focus is to empower research teams. A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go.
