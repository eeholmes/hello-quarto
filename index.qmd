# Hello, Quarto?

Julie: But also, we know you have questions. As long-time RMarkdown users, Mine and I did too. What is Quarto? Why Quarto? And how does it relate to RMarkdown and to other tools you already use and workflows you already have? Transition: Well -

It unifies the RMarkdown ecosystem by reducing little points of friction, so that websites, books, and slides all have a common approach.

And it extends the RMarkdown ecosystem as a friendly way for code and text to be published in the same place with tools that interoperate with how you already work.

Julie: Quarto is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The goal is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better. It handles inputs in multiple languages, and outputs in multiple formats, all going through the same machinery.

The interplay of how tools influence culture and vice versa is really exciting to me here: there is a really strong culture of reuse and teaching in the R community that has been driven by RMarkdown and excited to interoperate with other languages too

Thanks Julie!

I remember vividly the first time I've heard of knitr at useR 2012 and sitting in the audience and starting to convert my teaching materials to use it while the keynote was still going on.

I'll call this a success if a few of you are firing up a Quarto project right now to see what all the hype is about.

I'm very excited to have this opportunity to talk to you about Quarto, which I've had the opportunity to live and breathe over the last year. I am an educator -- a developer educator at RStudio and a professor at Duke. The word educator might make you think I'm in front of students, perhaps lecturing 24/7 but in reality I spend more of my time in front of my computer authoring and creating materials to share with the world: share with my students, share with my fellow educators, and share with anyone interested in learning the things I'm teaching. Sometimes I'm writing a slide deck for a talk, sometimes creating a website for a course, sometimes writing books, sometimes journal articles. Whatever it is that I create, I share them all openly - that is, with an open license that allows for free use and reuse and adaptation. More often than not I'm thinking "web first" to ease open sharing and wider reach, but I also still live in the confines of traditional journal publishing and academia, which means I regularly need to create PDFs as well. So an authoring system that allows for multiple types of outputs from a single source is not only a time saver, but basically essential for me to carry on my existence.

## Next generation R Markdown

![](images/rmd-to-quarto.gif){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Mine: Julie mentioned it unified so let's dig a bit more into what that means... It combines/unifies some "down" packages. It also brings in Jupyter and other languages (Python, Julia) and provides that functionality even if you're not coming from the R ecosystem. Beyond unification, Quarto also makes available attractive and handy features like tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc. consistently across the various outputs.

## DEMO: Flexibility in the formats

-   Take .Rmd and change extension to .qmd
    -   The .Rmd will already have a table and a plot, palmerpenguins
    -   Knit it, then change to .qmd. Knit again
    -   Note code chunk options, YAML completion, YAML errors (or other high-level differences)
-   Change output format to yml slides
-   Add a `_quarto.yml`, render to website
    -   *To hand-off to Julie: (a tiny website)*

:::

::: notes
Mine: A common first question is "how are R Markdown and Quarto different, under the hood, particularly given the rename of the file just works?"
:::

## Moving between "things" is ~~easy~~ straightforward

Moving between formats within Quarto is straightforward

-   Often need to deliver same/similar content in different formats (documents, slides, book, website)
-   It's super helpful when transitioning requires minimal futzing around with source code (like Rmd 8 ways...)

::: notes
Mine: As an educator, two things are of utmost importance for me about the tools I use to create my materials: reproducibility and ease of transition between output formats (like documents to slides to websites to books). Over the last year of using Quarto for everything, I've felt like I've finally found the tool that lets me go from one to the other with minimal futzing around with my source code. This has helped me focus my time on my content, which has been a huge win.

::: notes
Openscapes is a movement that meets teams where they are and helps them see what's possible and be resilient through open science.

This is what this movement looks like. We think of open science as this beautiful landscape full of data, tools and communities, with many existing paths forward.

Our flagship program is a cohort-based mentorship program for research teams that helps researchers move from lonely science like the animals on bottom left where this landscape is just out of view and to a place where they can identify what their trailhead looks like so they explore and navigate this landscape safely together.

Transition: This is one example of the impact for researchers -

::: notes
NASA Earthdata is migrating to the Cloud. This has been a tremendous effort over years from all corners of NASA.

Traditionally, these data are stored by 12 different data centers and researchers download the data in order to analyze it locally.

The new paradigm is Researchers will move their compute to the Cloud, which requires much more programmatic access rather than map- and menu-based access.

It also means that NASA staff needs to collaborate across Data Centers to support researchers with best practices in open science.

And this is how NASA Openscapes came to be

NASA-Openscapes is a 3-year project is to Develop a cross-NASA mentor community to create & teach common Earthdata Cloud tutorials that are then iterated for specific research examples

Since we started in early 2021 we've worked with just amazing group of NASA user support staff and engineers. We've supported them through finding the common needs across all Mentors, fostering a peer-learning and teaching culture, and having them contribute to shared activities as part of their jobs. And along with our mentorship we've also provided a 2i2c JupyterHub, AWS Cloud Credits, and Carpentries Instructor training.

As you'll see, this group has achieved a lot in the last year. And the successes of this project so far really speaks to the importance of leadership support plus empowered and connected early adopters. We've been really thankful to have both this top-down and grassroots level of support

Transition: So this is a big project. And while Erin had a decade of experience with the NASA community, when we started, a lot of it was new and frankly really intimidating to me. As a marine ecologist, I was unfamiliar with Earth science as a research domain, the types of satellite imagery data NASA works with, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly. And as an R user a fourth big thing that was intimidating to me -

But luckily, Quarto was emerging right when we needed it. I had been in touch with J.J. Allaire and knew Quarto was on the horizon. We asked if we could use Quarto for NASA-Openscapes and he and the Quarto team and it became a really exciting collaboration, where the quarto team and the NASA mentors were really gracious with learning and using and developing this tool, and it is very cool that through our work we've been able to help with some of its design too.

Julie: this is the first Quarto site we ever made. It's beautiful, right out of the box with the default settings. This cookbook s a collection of how-to guides and tutorials made by the NASA Openscapes Mentors. We were able to make this place very early on, and we could see our end-goal Transition: And what's cool is that this quarto site is made up of many coding languages -
:::

## Collaborate across coding languages {.julie}

::: illustration
**Image:** `_quarto.yml`: `.ipynbs`, with `.rmds`

In fact, it's mostly .ipynbs as you see in this simplifid view of our `_quarto.yml` file. Being able to make a collection of tutorials in different language and filetypes has been a huge benefit for us working together.
:::

## Screenshot: RStudio IDE, VSCode, Jupyter...

::: notes
And, we're all able to work in whatever tool we're already comfortable with as we contributed to this cookbook, which is possible since you install quarto as a command line too like git; it's not an R package or a python package. So with people working in their current tools and Quarto working in each case, we didn't need people to shift their software tools and instead could focus on upskilling around common pieces like Quarto and GitHub, but we didn't need to upset or shift everyone's software workflows, we could weave Quarto into existing workflows.

And this has also have dividends because while I said that the Earth science community is python-heavy what we've learned the more we work with this NASA Cloud data we see there is a significant R community and we're positioned to support them with this workflow we've developed because of Quarto it's not language-specific

How academics share their teaching resources/ new avenues for publishing:

-   Tooling that makes it easy to share what you do with the world on the web is incredibly *useful* -- if it's not easy to make a course website, you won't.
-   It's *useful* to the world -- Open sharing of knowledge, other people can learn from and reuse.
-   It's [useful]{.underline} to you -- It's a way of getting credit for your work, and when it comes time for annual review/promotion materials, it's easy to say "here is everything I created".

::: notes
Mine: I started off introducing myself as a prof and educator, and so you probably have an idea of what my responsibilities look like, but you might not know my practices. Teaching, writing, and research are three things I do as an educator, and I can do it all with Quarto in ways that look very similar under the hood but very different in output. (Maybe add PPT anecdote here.)

:::
:::

::: notes
One of the ways you welcome people is making the implicit explicit

Writing things down is a way to build inclusion into your daily work, so that there's not unspoken rules that can exclude people.

Gavin Fay's lab at UMass Dartmouth was mentored through Openscapes and they then went and wrote a public lab manual that puts their values forward. This was a way to builds trust, psych safety, and resilience with the team, and was particuarly important as they had new members join their lab remotely during the Pandemic.

Transition: And another form of Welcome that this lab manual enabled -

*Slowing down to speed up*

:::
:::

::: notes
They could onboard learners as contributors. 

What this looked like was that when new people joined the lab, they read the lab manual and were encouraged to edit it to, make clarifying edits, fix broken links, and add new content to help fill in any gaps.

And their approach to contributing evolved. First it was "if you find something broken let us know" and the it was "let's screenshare so you learn how to fix it yourself.

This meant slowing down to speed up, and was a nice long-term way to invest in and maintain the documentation and the community at the same time.

We've also been using this approach of onboarding learners as contributors as we've gotten to know Quarto more. It's cool to see NOAA reusing the ideas from NASA as well!

## Reuse (and credit!) good ideas {.julie}

*Open science as a way to work*

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/cookbook_contributing.png){width="70%"}
:::
:::

::: notes
Another way to welcome people is to reuse and credit good ideas to help them propogate. We loved how the FayLab made the implict explicit and brought that idea to NASA.

As we were first dev'ing the NASA Mentor community, there wasn't a place to make the implicit explicit. Quarto gave them that place - this is the Cookbook you saw earlier but with the Contributing section expanded

Catalina has said how Quarto has given her a place to share ideas earlier, comfortable sharing imperfect work and getting feedback. 

One of the things here is that open science is a way to work. It's not just about products, it's about process. It's about people.

Transition: So these examples so far have been about openly creating documentation for your team, which is a big part of reimagining how we work. And it's also an opportunity to extend this in other resources as well.

<br>

::: notes
With the NASA mentors, we found it really important to create learner-oriented resources that we could then reuse.

I've so far been showing the NASA Cookbook, which was where we first started, and developed the contributing section. But we found that was not the place to first develop teaching resources, because we didn't know our audience. It was when we had hackathon event planned that we were able to develop tutorials for specific learners, knowing a bit about where they were starting from, how much time we had, and the learning goals. So the mentors were able to design these tutorials with empathy for specific learners. And since they were familiar with a collaborative workflow with Quarto, they could turn around and reuse the tutorials they co-developed and tailor them further to other audiences' specific needs.

There are at least 10 examples I can show you since last fall - These slides are another example of rapid iteration with Quarto, they are one of the first slide decks directly from a Jupyter notebook, and Amy Stieker who created them worked closely with the Quarto team to

So it was really this hackathon event that the mentors have been reusing and iterating and now we're focused on bringing the common kind of "source" lessons back into the Cookbook as the keystone resource, but not the other way around like we had first thought.

## Collaborate across coding comfort levels {.julie}

*Reinforce a peer-learning & teaching culture*

![](images/visual_editor.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

::: notes
And throughout all of this is the idea that we can collaborate across coding comfort levels. It's been really neat to see how Quarto can not only reduce barriers across coding languages like python and R, but also differnt experience levels.

This is a screenshot of the new Visual Editor that is part of the RStudio IDE, and it's something we've been experimenting with more and more. We've found this to be a really nice way to write prose even for those familiar with Markdown, but it's also a friendlier way for people to get to know the tools.

This is about not assuming technical skills, but creating an safe culture where they can say what they don't know and reinforce a peer-learning & teaching culture, and using tooling that is friendly for new and seasoned coders alike.

Transition: Let me demo Quarto with the Visual editor - it's really exciting to blur those lines between who identifies as a coder or not using these tools collaboratively.

Just as we chose to go to the moon<br> We know it's never too soon<br> To choose hope.<br> We choose to do more than cope<br> With climate change<br> We choose to end it---<br> We refuse to lose.<br> Together we do this and more<br> Not because it's very easy or nice<br> But because it is necessary,<br> Because with every dawn we carry<br> the weight of the fate of this celestial body orbiting a star.<br> And as heavy as that weight sounded, it doesn't hold us down,<br> But it keeps us grounded, steady, ready,<br> Because an environmental movement of this size<br> Is simply another form of an earthrise.<br>
