**Mine:** Much of my work, and much of Julie's work is collaborative.
So, over to you Julie, for collaborating with Quarto.

**Julie:** Thank you Mine -

I work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. What I absolutely love doing is mentoring, teaching, and empowering communities, having learned from so many of you in the R and Mozilla communities, and wanting to pay this forward and welcome others.

I've made this my job through Openscapes.

There are mountains in the background. The Openscapes hex logo is in the top left hand corner. In the foreground there are many animals: hermit crab working alone on a laptop, a sad rabbit on a laptop under a raincloud, a frustrated skunk on a laptop under a raincloud. Just over a bush is another group of animals: a fox with a welcome sign stands with a hedgehog holding map brochures In front of a larger park map. The fox and hedgehog are in front of a group of animals: a heron, a squirrel, a mouse holding a notebook, a raccoon, a snake, and a quail. In the midground, thereâ€™s a turtle, deer, owl and beaver by the river that has stepping stone rocks across. A roadrunner, lizard, blue bird, and rabbit, are walking down a path together, one of the other paths is blocked by a log. Thereâ€™s a rowboat on the edge of the water. In the background, a duck, turtle, red squirrel, fox, and raven are walking single file over a wooden bridge that crosses the river. Most of the animals have coloured bandanas tied around their necks and a few are wearing hats. Up in the sky, thereâ€™s a satellite. Overlaid on the image is the OpenScapes hex logo."}

Openscapes is an approach and a movement that I launched in 2018 and have built together with my partner Erin Robinson. 

Our flagship activity is mentoring research teams in open science. We think of open science as a landscape full of open source software, data, and communities, and many paths forward.

::: notes
We help people move from the sad lonely animals like the foreground in the bottom right so that they start to explore and navigate this landscape safely, without too much trampling.  Our role is to welcome them at the trail head, helping them seem themselves as a team and identify where they are all starting from

We work with professional research groups in government, academia, nonprofits, and we help these teams modernize their workflows and shift culture with their teams and organization through open software and practices. Adyan Rios from NOAA Fisheries and she's described Openscapes as saying:

"As fisheries scientists, we know that when we're in rough seas, it's important to keep the ship afloat AND get out of the storm. Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of email chains with 37 versions of the same spreadsheet and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R"

I have the best job - mentoring teams like Adyan's who are doing really critical work and we help them do better science by connecting them to the tools and resources you all make. 

It really blends mentoring and collabortion, and that is definitely true of our story with NASA.

::: notes
With NASA you probably think about outer space, but they also collects an unbelievable amount of data about Earth. Researchers use NASA Earthdata in many ways including to understand and address impacts to the heat waves and wildfires like we're increasingly seeing in summers due to climate change.

These data are freely available from 12 different NASA data centers - but researchers have to download it to analyze it locally - which puts a lot of burden on research groups.

Now, following years of the preparation, these data are migrating to the Cloud, and NASA data centers are supporting researchers who will be migrating their analytical workflows to the Cloud too.

::: notes
My partner Erin had 10 years of experience working with the NASA Earthdata community and she brought NASA and Openscapes together in a 3 year project to help this transition.

Our focus is in developing a mentor community across those 12 data centers to co-create and teach common tutorials with NASA Earthdata Cloud.

So let me just stop here and say this is big project.

And, it was really intimidating to me. NASA is an org I've looked up to my whole life, and I wasn't familiar with the types and size of Earthdata, types of research questions, or cloud infrastructure

\<\> And an additional intimidating thing to me -

[Many Earth scientists <br> use Python <br> ðŸ˜¬]{.larger}

::: notes
Many Earth scientists use python and jupyter notebooks. And my role leading NASA Openscapes was not to learn python from the ground-up, but I needed to be able to collaborate and support python users.

Transition: But I also brought over 6 years of experience and confidence that I've developed using RMarkdown. I think of RMarkdown like a superpower

::: notes
And Quarto let me bring this superpower to python.

Quarto was emerging right when we needed it, and I asked J.J. Allaire if we could use for NASA Openscapes. This became a really exciting collaboration with the Quarto developer team and the NASA Mentors and we were able to use it basically out of the box but also we motivated certain features, particularly in the freeze feature that just Mine introduced.

::: notes
This Quarto site we made for our first teaching event. 

This is where we really found traction in working together as a Mentor community: we were able to make a beautiful collection of tutorials that was helpful for our own development and was a friendly place for our learners.

Quarto was also something for us all to learn together. And that was really important bc it turned out I wasn't the only person feeling intimidated about all the moving parts. We were able to identify other skills to learn together.

So from this investment in our workflow and learning  -

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding languages. This is a simplified view of the yaml it's collection of different file types. It's mostly ipynbs Jupyter notebooks.

And, as we work with more research teams we've found that there is indeed a substantial R community using NASA Earthdata Cloud data. And we're positioned to support R users too

we're all able to contribute from whatever tool we're already comfortable with. In our group some use RStudio, some use JupyterLab some VS Code, some directly edit documents on GitHub.

And this was important because of all the new things we were learning together, we didn't also need people to shift their software tools.

::: notes
-   Orient to JupyterLab. This is a JupyterHub managed by our collaborators at 2i2c
-   Open Mine's example site, quarto preview
- add .ipynb 
-   Add `.ipynb` to `_quarto.yml`
-   View website - new page is added to website
-  Add fig captions
- margin plots: a style prefrred by many now in jupyter notebook
