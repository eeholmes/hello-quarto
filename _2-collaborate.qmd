Thanks Mine. I've learned so much from what others have shared openly and it's influenced so much about how I collaborate too

As you heard earlier I work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science.
What I absolutely love doing is mentoring, teaching, and empowering communities, having learned from so many of you who are here or listening today.

I've made this my job through Openscapes.

There are mountains in the background. The Openscapes hex logo is in the top left hand corner. In the foreground there are many animals: hermit crab working alone on a laptop, a sad rabbit on a laptop under a raincloud, a frustrated skunk on a laptop under a raincloud. Just over a bush is another group of animals: a fox with a welcome sign stands with a hedgehog holding map brochures In front of a larger park map. The fox and hedgehog are in front of a group of animals: a heron, a squirrel, a mouse holding a notebook, a raccoon, a snake, and a quail. In the midground, thereâ€™s a turtle, deer, owl and beaver by the river that has stepping stone rocks across. A roadrunner, lizard, blue bird, and rabbit, are walking down a path together, one of the other paths is blocked by a log. Thereâ€™s a rowboat on the edge of the water. In the background, a duck, turtle, red squirrel, fox, and raven are walking single file over a wooden bridge that crosses the river. Most of the animals have coloured bandanas tied around their necks and a few are wearing hats. Up in the sky, thereâ€™s a satellite."}

Openscapes is a movement and a community that I launched in 2018 and have built together with my partner Erin Robinson.

Our flagship activity is mentoring research teams in open practices that can increase inclusive collaboration and accelerate data-driven solutions. 

We think of open science as a landscape full of open source software, data, and communities, and many paths forward. 

Our role is welcome folks at the trailhead, helping them move from feeling stuck and alone like these sad animals on bottom left and identify what's common with their team so they can safely explore and navigate this landscape safely together.

We work primarily with environmental researchers, many who have been marine scientists and R users like me. One participant Adyan Rios has described this as saying:

"As fisheries scientists, we know that when we're in rough seas, it's important to keep the ship afloat AND get out of the storm. Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of email chains with 37 versions of the same spreadsheet and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R"

Working with research teams really blurs the lines between mentoring and collaboration, and that is definitely true of the story I'd like to tell you about NASA.

With NASA you probably think about outer space, but they also collects an unbelievable amount of data about Earth. Researchers use NASA Earthdata to tackle all kinds of questions about our planet like XXX that are especially important to address the impacts of climate change.

However, these data are stored by 12 different data centers around the US and researchers have to download data separately from each data center and analyze it locally - until now.

Now, as a result of many years of the preparation these 12 data centers are migrating these data to the Cloud, hosted by AWS and others. And, in anticipation and support of this, the data centers will also support researchers who will be migrate their analytical workflows to the Cloud too.

My partner Erin had 10 years of experience working with NASA Earthdata and she brought NASA and Openscapes together in a 3 year project that we lead together. 

Our focus is in developing a mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers that has a unified approach to co-creating and teaching common tutorials to support researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud

So let me just stop here and say this is a big project. 

And, it was really intimidating to me. Just working with NASA was intimidating to me, this is a huge organization that I've looked up to my whole life. Plus, I'm new to the kinds of data I'm new to earth science as a research discipline, I'm new to the kinds of remotely sensed data, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly.

\<\> And as an R user a fourth big thing that was intimidating to me -

::: notes
Many NASA Earth scientists use python, and all tutorial development was focused in jupyter notebooks.
And my role leading NASA Openscapes was not to learn python from the ground-up, but I needed to be able to collaborate and role model collaboration with python users.
Transition:
So I was intimiated about all this, but I also brought something really powerful to this work. And that's the experience and confidence I've developed as an RMarkdown user for over 8 years. RMarkdown has so reshaped how I think about what's possible that I think of it as a superpower.

And Quarto let me bring this superpower to collaborating with python folks. 

Quarto was emerging right when we needed it; I had been collaborating with J.J.
Allaire over the past few years and I asked if we could use Quarto for NASA-Openscapes. It was still quite early in its development and it became a really exciting collaboration with the Quarto developer team and the NASA Mentors, not only to be able to use this tool but also helped influence some of its design, particularly in the freeze feature that just Mine introduced.

This Quarto site we made for the Fall 2021 Cloud Hackathon. Developing tutorials for this teaching event was really where we really found traction in working together and building this Mentor community. 

Quarto provided this place for us to collect those tutorials and present them in beautiful way for the hackathon participants, and that helped us develop tutorials thinking about those learners and really focusing our tutorial development with empathy for those learners.

And it also gave us a way to learn something new together and identify other things to learn together. And it turned out this was really important, that I wasn't the only person feeling intimidated by new tech and moving pieces and how to collaborate most effectively. We had all been assuming that everyone else knew things we didn't and had it all figured out. It turned out it was really important that we had been building this trust and psychological safety so that we had room to grow and learn - 
ould ask questions, getting comfortable learning new things, sharing imperfect work, giving feedback.

So from this investment in technology and collaboration,

In fact, it's mostly .ipynbs as you see in this simplified view of our `_quarto.yml` file.
Being able to make a collection of tutorials in different language and file types has been a huge benefit for us working together.

This is the setup we've had and it's good because it turns out there is a big R community we are set up to support!

In our group, some use RStudio, some VS Code, some the GitHub IDE, and some JupyterLab

And, we're all able to work in whatever tool we're already comfortable with as we contributed to this cookbook, which is possible since you install quarto as a command line too like git; it's not an R package or a python package.
So with people working in their current tools and Quarto working in each case, we didn't need people to shift their software tools and instead could focus on upskilling around common pieces like Quarto and GitHub, but we didn't need to upset or shift everyone's software workflows, we could weave Quarto into existing workflows.

And this has also have dividends because while I said that the Earth science community is python-heavy what we've learned the more we work with this NASA Cloud data we see there is a significant R community and we're positioned to support them with this workflow we've developed because of Quarto it's not language-specific

What's been neat about using your own tools is that it allows us to learn Quarto from the comfort of our own "homes" and this has teaching implications that Mine will talk about next.
