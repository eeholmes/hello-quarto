Thanks Mine. I've learned so much from what others have shared openly and it's influenced so much about how I collaborate too

As you heard earlier I work at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science.
What I absolutely love doing is mentoring, teaching, and empowering communities, having learned from so many of you who are here or listening today.

I've made this my job through Openscapes.

There are mountains in the background. The Openscapes hex logo is in the top left hand corner. In the foreground there are many animals: hermit crab working alone on a laptop, a sad rabbit on a laptop under a raincloud, a frustrated skunk on a laptop under a raincloud. Just over a bush is another group of animals: a fox with a welcome sign stands with a hedgehog holding map brochures In front of a larger park map. The fox and hedgehog are in front of a group of animals: a heron, a squirrel, a mouse holding a notebook, a raccoon, a snake, and a quail. In the midground, thereâ€™s a turtle, deer, owl and beaver by the river that has stepping stone rocks across. A roadrunner, lizard, blue bird, and rabbit, are walking down a path together, one of the other paths is blocked by a log. Thereâ€™s a rowboat on the edge of the water. In the background, a duck, turtle, red squirrel, fox, and raven are walking single file over a wooden bridge that crosses the river. Most of the animals have coloured bandanas tied around their necks and a few are wearing hats. Up in the sky, thereâ€™s a satellite. Overlaid on the image is the OpenScapes hex logo."}

Openscapes is a movement and a community that I launched in 2018 and have built together with my partner Erin Robinson.

Our flagship activity is mentoring research teams in open practices that can increase inclusive collaboration and accelerate data-driven solutions. 

We think of open science as a landscape full of open source software, data, and communities, and many paths forward. 

Our role is welcome folks at the trailhead, helping them move from feeling stuck and alone like these sad animals on bottom left and identify what's common with their team so they can safely explore and navigate this landscape safely together.

We work primarily with environmental researchers, many who have been marine scientists and R users like me. One participant Adyan Rios has described this as saying:

"As fisheries scientists, we know that when we're in rough seas, it's important to keep the ship afloat AND get out of the storm. Openscapes helps teams steer out of the storm of email chains with 37 versions of the same spreadsheet and to the calmer waters of open science and meaningful collaboration, using tools like R"

Working with research teams really XXreduces between mentoring and collaboration, and that is definitely true of the story I'd like to tell you about NASA.

::: notes
With NASA you probably think about outer space, but they also collects an unbelievable amount of data about Earth. Researchers use NASA Earthdata to tackle all kinds of questions about our planet like XXX that are especially important to address the impacts of climate change.

These data are stored by 12 different data centers around the US and researchers have to download sometimes terrabyes of data and analyze it locally - which puts a lot of burden on research groups using this data.

Now,following many years of the preparation, these 12 data centers are migrating these data to the Cloud, hosted by AWS and others. Aligning with this migration the data centers will support researchers who will be migrating their analytical workflows to the Cloud too.

My partner Erin had 10 years of experience working with NASA Earthdata and she brought NASA and Openscapes together in a 3 year project that we lead together. 

Our focus is in developing a mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers that has a unified approach to co-creating and teaching common tutorials to support researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud

So let me just stop here and say this is a big project. 

And, it was really intimidating to me. Just working with NASA was intimidating to me, this is a huge organization that I've looked up to my whole life. Plus, I'm new to the kinds of data I'm new to earth science as a research discipline, I'm new to the kinds of remotely sensed data, not to mention cloud infrastructure that is evolving rapidly.

\<\> And as an R user a fourth big thing that was intimidating to me -

[Many Earth scientists <br> use Python <br> ðŸ˜¬]{.larger}

::: notes
Many NASA Earth scientists use python, and all tutorial development was focused in jupyter notebooks.
And my role leading NASA Openscapes was not to learn python from the ground-up, but I needed to be able to collaborate and role model collaboration with python users.
Transition:
So I was intimiated about all this, but I also brought something really powerful to this work. And that's the experience and confidence I've developed as an RMarkdown user for over 8 years. RMarkdown has so reshaped how I think about what's possible that I think of it as a superpower.

::: notes
And Quarto let me bring this superpower to collaborating with python folks. 

Quarto was emerging right when we needed it; I had been collaborating with J.J.
Allaire over the past few years and I asked if we could use Quarto for NASA-Openscapes. It was still quite early in its development and it became a really exciting collaboration with the Quarto developer team and the NASA Mentors, not only to be able to use this tool but also helped influence some of its design, particularly in the freeze feature that just Mine introduced.

This Quarto site we made for the Fall 2021 Cloud Hackathon. Developing tutorials for this teaching event was really where we really found traction in working together as a Mentor community. Openscapes had been providing the space for people to come together, and 

Quarto provided the place for us to work together and build a collection of the tutorials and present them in beautiful way for the hackathon participants.

Quartot also gave us a way to learn something new together and that helped see other parts of our workflow where we could learn more together, like with GitHub Actions. And it turned out this was really important, that I wasn't the only person feeling intimidated by new tech and moving pieces and how to collaborate most effectively. We had all been assuming what everyone else knew rather than asking and talking about it

So from this investment in technology and collaboration,

Followed quickly by other iterations we were able to do with this same workflow. They created other Quart sites for workshops as well as slide decks, as well as a central place to put the more stable tutorials that they had taught and tested (in a process that is reminding me more and more of how you would develop an R package from little scripts that you've tested and then modularlized). And all of these all of these sites are built from Jupyter notebooks.

Julie: ...

transition: So to emphasize two key things from our work with NASA Openscapes and Quarto:

## Quarto enables collaborating <br>across coding languages {.takeaway .center highlight-style="github"}

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding languages.  This is a simplified view of the yaml from the Cloud Cookbook - you see it's collection of tutorials with different file types. It's mostly ipynbs and markdown since that is where we have started with our first year with the NASA Mentors.

And, as we work with more research teams using NASA Earthdata Cloud data science we've found that why it is python heavey there is indeed a substantial R community as well. And we're positioned to support R users too since this workflow we've developed with Quarto it's not language-specific! We'll be increasing our support for R users and experimenting more with reticulate to interoperate more between Python and R so stay tuned.

And, a second thing is that we're all able to contribute from whatever tool we're already comfortable with. I've just demoed jupyter but in fact in our group some use RStudio, some VS Code, some directly edit documents on GitHub. 

And this was important because of all the new things we were learning together, we didn't also need people to shift their software tools. Instead, everyone has been able to learn Quarto from the comfort of our own "homes".
