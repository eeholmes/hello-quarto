- But our Quarto story starts with NASA - beachball. Then infuse static images in background
- Sometimes storms are upon us, and sometimes we can see them coming. EXTEND Storm metaphor



Arthur Ashe: start where you are, do what you can.

LIZ: individ with quote from Ayana. FOcus on the individual things you can do individual but with pandemic we can't individual our ways out of this. We need community Then you need to partner with other people. That's how we get to this movement


## And while there's so much potential

["People feel frustrated, they're siloed, they're not connected with their team, or even feel like they have a team. There are technical and cultural barriers - they need new skills but don't have space to learn new things." <br>- Eli Holmes, NOAA Fisheries (Northwest)]{.quote}


From there we've been working with Quarto books with the NOAA fish folks



And they work with python - Quarto. 

We were able to meet everyone where they were and reduce friction

now show a screengrab.

When I see this my stomach flips over because I don't know jupyter notebooks
This was all sitting heavily on me until one day when I was talking with J.J. Allaire about Quarto And I thought well that would be nice.
And indeed it is right

We were these independently sad animals, I became one of those teams. Many paths

Drawing from my own experience as a scientist is that science can be lonely. Not being able to see over the hill to see what's possible I am a scientist and I started over here as a sad animal, science can be lonely. and the R cummunity has been a big part of me joining this community. And I launched Openscapes to help others do the same. Meanwhile, my partner Erin Robinson was also a sad animal and we came together


I co-developed Openscapes with my partner Erin Robinson. Together we've developed it into an impactful program that builds from the foundations when I first launched it as a Mozilla Fellow. I launched Openscapes based on my experiences as a researcher transitioning to better science, and co-developed it with my partner Erin Robinson of Metadata GameChangers. Together, we've built it into a sustainable and scalable program that we're really excited about.

There is a lot more to this but what's particularly relevant here is that the R community has played a huge role in shaping this.

Julie: We think about open science as landscape of open data, tooling, and communities, with many existing paths forward, as well as opportunities to create new paths together. Our main focus is to empower research teams. A lot of people feel stuck, like these sad animals in the bottom left, or are working alone, like the little hermit crab, with the landscape just out of view. We help folks find common parts of their work and come together as teams and identify their trailhead so they can safely navigate this landscape, and help each other and welcome others as they go. "that's Erin and me"
